Those tendencies are in opposition: if you can win through luck or charm, it can feel like the planning aspect gets devalued. This, however, is the closest a game has yet come to hitting it right on the nose. It’s an approachable game, but its tactical aspects are novel, labyrinthine and beautifully circular, a maze which, once mastered, allows you to build a platform on which dice and diplomacy can give you a slight edge. It’s an awesome thing to behold, carving a story arc of its own right through the annals of board game design.', 'Arcs is not the first game to try and balance challenging strategic elements with the classic fun of negotiation and dice-rolling, but it’s a very tough task to get it right. Arcs nails it.', 'Space conquest games are ten a penny, including some of the best war board games around, like Twilight Imperium and Eclipse. But for all their glory, they tend to follow a formula known as 4X: explore, expand, exploit and exterminate. That means capturing resources, climbing up a tech tree and fighting your neighbors, with all the potential for turtling and table talk that that involves. Arcs, by innovative designer Cole Wehrle, looks very much like its genre peers, but it promises to be something different: a sci-fi subjugation game that puts strategy front and center, while weaving the inbuilt instability of growing empires into the mix.;For a genre that traditionally comes with a ton of plastic and cardboard, Arcs arrives in a disarmingly small box that’s packed to the brim with goodies. It features wooden pieces rather than plastic, but its single spaceship design cutouts and agent pieces still look great on your table. Your other units, cities and spaceports, are represented by cardboard triangles. It’s all functional, and thematically austere, and you won’t miss the plastic at all.;One reason why such relatively plain components look so good is the instantly-recognizable art style of Kyle Ferrin which adorns the pieces, cards and board. It initially appears sketchy and amateurish until you see how much detail, character and consistency goes into his portrayals. Better known for his fantasy work on other titles from Leder Games such as Root and Oath, his transition to sci-fi is seamless and elevates the game’s appearance to the next level. The card art in particular, split across several decks, is a delight.;Genre veterans may be slightly surprised by the board, which is compact and features various administrative tracks alongside a circular map outlined in more Ferrin art. But like everything else in the box, it does exactly what it needs to do while looking surprisingly stylish, with neon tones standing out against a classic black space background. Some resource tokens, player mats and a hefty selection of custom combat dice round out the contents.;You might be surprised to find that a mutated derivative of classic playing card trick-taking, where one player leads a card suit and others have to follow, is at the heart of a 4x game. But that’s what we’ve got here, representing the player’s inability to perfectly control their forces. It’s a typical left-field move from Wehrle, whose creativity can make his games feel hard to grasp. Arcs is no exception, but the good news is that it’s both simpler and more familiar than most of his oeuvre, and you should have everything down quite comfortably by the end of your first session.;Leading is a significant advantage because it allows you to control the tempo of the entire turn. The suit of the card you play determines what actions you can take, such as building, moving or attacking other players, and the number of pips tells you how many of those actions you’re allowed. If you’re going first, you can also declare the ambition printed on the card, which is essentially deciding which facet of the game is going to be worth points on this round, such as having most of a particular resource, or destroying the most enemy pieces in battle, although doing so sets the numeric value of the card to zero.;Players following the leader have difficult decisions to make. If they can match the suit and play a higher value card – easy if the leader went with the ambition – then they can also take the named actions up the number of pips, plus they get to lead next round. Otherwise, their card only gets them a single action, either of the lead type or the type they played, with an option to discard another card to gain that precious lead slot.;Immediately, this snares everyone is a series of strategic traps. Leading is powerful, but if you declare an ambition, you’ll likely lose the initiative, yet if you don’t someone else may later pick a scoring opportunity that’s unfavorable to you. If you’re following, and you can’t beat the lead card, you need to consider whether the high, high price of discarding a card, leaving you out of later rounds completely, is worth it to grab the initiative. And that’s before we even get to what you’re actually going to do with your cards and actions.;Initially, this can feel suffocating, robbing you of choice and demanding pounds of flesh to get the initiative. But with experience you’ll learn there’s nuance here, a surprising amount of strategy around card-counting and timing. And much of the rest of Arcs is dedicated to ensuring you’ve got options, even in the most barren hands of cards imaginable, although there is, as always, a cost for exercising that flexibility.;One method is to sacrifice resources to gain actions. Giving up a fuel allows you to move, for example, or a material to build or repair. Doing so, however, puts you at a disadvantage for ambitions based on that resource, and you’ll need some of that resource in the first place. You gain resources via the tax action on cities, and the planet they’re on determines which resource you get. You start with two cities, so to gain access to new resource types you need to move a fleet there, either battle to take control or build to found a new city, then tax to get your token. It’s no small undertaking, with a whole series of strategic trade-offs to get there.;The other ameliorating factor are guild cards. There are always a selection of four available, and they provide various new powers and resources. Mining Interest will get you a material resource, for example, while Lattice Spies can be discarded to seize the initiative. Getting a card requires two actions: influence, which lets you place agent pieces on an unclaimed card, and secure, which allows you to take a card on which you have a majority of agents. As always, there’s a sting: if another player claims a card on which you have agents, they capture them. This not only deprives you of their use, but the tally of captured agents is another point-scoring opportunity.;Hopefully you can begin to sell the wheels within wheels within wheels of planning a turn in Arcs. Everything is deviously and brilliantly reliant on everything else. Nothing can be achieved without risk or sacrifice. The game hands you all the tools you need to manage this fraught state of affairs but tells you nothing about how to use them: some of the aspects don’t even look like tools at first, just infuriating bits of chaos or mechanical straitjackets that exist only to annoy until you encounter the circumstance in which you can leverage them, and comprehension dawns like an alien sun rising over an extraterrestrial world. But even as you gain experience, trying to make everything join up, to push all the buttons to your advantage, is a fascinating, difficult, multi-faceted challenge that doesn’t get old.;And I haven’t even got to the fact that all the other players will be trying their best to sabotage your plans. Nothing stops players negotiating or making deals so, atop that solid mechanical core, this is a red-blooded game of dynamic aggression, where both dynamic and aggression are the operative words. The movement system and circular board makes it very hard to defend yourself, or to turtle in corners. You might get one speedbump to slow an enemy fleet en route to your major systems, but that’s it. This ensures every turn when battle actions are available ramp up the tension, as everyone tries to be first to take the fight to the enemy.;When fights do erupt, they’re governed by a fascinating, novel dice mechanic. For each ship they have, the attack can choose a type of dice to roll. Skirmish dice have a 50-50 chance of inflicting minor damage. Assault dice are far more punishing, but they carry a risk of damaging your own ships. Raid dice are the most dangerous for the attacker, but they allow you to steal resources from your opponent. The risk versus reward ratio is very much on you, but pieces can take two hits each and the attacker gets to allocate all damage. So Arcs rewards aggression, since the attacking player can eliminate enemy pieces while distributing damage among their own.', None)\n",

However, Undaunted: Stalingrad bucks that trend with changes that elevate the excellent original in every way. The two forces are more diverse, the scenario design is far more engaging and the campaign rules are outstanding. Its primary problem is one of commitment: to get the most from this box you’ll have to play it over the long haul, a dozen or more games to reach a conclusion. Finding that kind of time to dedicate to one game is rare these days. But if there’s one title that ought to encourage players to stick to it and really eke the economic, strategic and emotional value out of a single game, it’s this.', 'Undaunted: Stalingrad makes lots of smart changes that elevate the excellent original in every way.', \"Undaunted: Normandy came out of nowhere in 2019 and became enough of a hit to spawn a sequel and an expansion. As you can guess from the title, it’s another board game in a very long list of games about the battles in northern France during World War II. What made Undaunted different was the way it represented soldiers and officers using a deck of cards that players could add to during the game to tweak their strategy. It was so good we put it on our best deck-building games and best war board games lists.;With Undaunted: Stalingrad, the designers have moved the action to Eastern Front, but this isn’t just a reskin. It’s a whole new game with a novel, dedicated campaign system.;Undaunted: Stalingrad comes in a big, heavy box with a big, heavy price tag. There are two colossal stacks of cardboard tiles that are used to build the city-scapes the 2-players will fight over during the course of the campaign. In fact, if you lay out all the tiles in rows and number order, it’ll make a rough map of the historical city. One set of tiles is for the starting situation of the map. The other is a set of replacements for those tiles if the originals get destroyed or fortified as part of the action.;It’s a similar story for the decks of cards that make up the remainder of the weight. There’s one lot for the German player and another for the Soviets. The starting decks are functionally identical. But as play goes on, your deck will suffer permanent casualties as well as expand with new options. These additions are not the same for both sides but represent operational and material differences between them, addressing a common critique of the original game.;Some 10-sided dice and sheets of punch-out counters representing different squads, vehicles and scenery as well as battlefield markers round out the contents. The slightly cartoonish style used in the cards and tiles across the Undaunted games is a bit of an acquired taste given the serious subject matter. But for this fourth outing, artist Roland MacDonald has nailed the balance of realism and caricature required. It’s also good to see some realistic diversity among the Soviet forces, including women and various ethnic backgrounds.;Deck-building, where players start with a core of cards and use them to buy additional cards during the game, is a well-worn design concept. However, in most deck-building games the deck-building is the entire point. What sets Undaunted apart is the way that the designers make the deck stand in for aspects of morale and unit cohesion without any additional rules overhead. There is, of course, a decent luck factor in the card draw that may, or may not, support what you need to do on the board. But there’s plenty of strategy, too.;Players start each turn with four cards: they play one in a nerve-wracking bid to see who will go first, and the other three on their turn. Most cards represent battlefield units and allow the player to take an action with the corresponding counter on the board, such as moving, or shooting, which is resolved via a d10 roll. On a hit, a corresponding card is removed from the deck. So the more units come under fire, the less likely they are to act and the less reliable they become, simply because their cards are less likely to get drawn.;Decks also include non-commissioned officer cards. These don’t activate units but add cards to your deck or draw more cards from it. This corresponds to pep talks, courageous leadership and using reinforcements to patch up ailing forces. But try to coordinate too many different units and you'll find your key cards won’t turn up in the confusion. The final type of card is Fog of War which does nothing but clog up your hand. These represent battlefield uncertainty and are gained when you scout out new tiles, a prerequisite for moving.;Adding to your deck and taking actions on the board are your levers in trying to meet the scenario objectives. These are far more diverse than previous Undaunted games, which were mostly a race to control specific victory tiles. That’s still a thing here but it’s complemented by frantic timed defenses and desperate demolitions, helped by a wider range of tiles with simple scenery rules. There are even scenarios with secret intelligence that you don’t reveal to your opponent until triggered. This variety means there are multiple ways to approach each battle, with subtleties of strategy that you might not tease out until it’s too late. You’ll also need to change your plans on the fly in response to the dynamic situation on the ground.;It’s a system that forces you into endless awkward compromises. Riflemen, for example, are the only cards that can control tiles. But unless you have multiple matching cards you can’t both move and take control in the same turn. Instead, you have to risk them creeping forward, closing range and making them an easier target while allowing the enemy the chance to move up and contest the tile themselves. Most units have special actions, like engineers launching smoke or machine gunners laying suppressing fire, that you’ll have to balance with the need to move, shoot, and complete objectives. It’s an ongoing, fraught series of tough trade-offs.;Scenarios get teed up according to a branching structure that depends on who won the previous battle. Each side has a scenario book with the setup and a brief narrative introduction to the next fight. Many scenarios make new cards available to your deck, from off-map assets like bombers to on-map tanks. Victory always wins you something, maybe it’s control of a section of the city or an extra promotion. Depending on how things unfold, the campaign can come to a sudden end -- or it can culminate in a colossal battle for final dominance over the city. However, the loser in a scenario often gets a slight starting advantage in the setup for the next one, helping to keep things even.;As a result, Undaunted: Stalingrad encourages you to think long-term. At the end of each fight, you take casualties depending on how many cards you lost. If these turn out to be line soldiers, they’re replaced with inferior reserve cards, while specialists like snipers or engineers are lost permanently. You also promote two cards, which get swapped for superior alternatives. So it’s no longer a case of sending in the troops, gung-ho to secure objectives. Every decision is a compromise where taking a risk might pay off with a win but hobble your deck for the remainder of the campaign. This adds a brilliant frisson of danger to even simple choices and makes conceding a strategic decision rather than a cop-out.;The scheme of swapping out cards or tiles for replacements means you pay for a lot of stuff in the box that you won’t use. But it also forms the basis of a superb campaign system. Ongoing campaigns are tricky things because as one side ekes out an advantage it tends to snowball. Between the balance changes in scenario setup and the regular, vicious grind of attrition that both sides suffer, this is unlikely to happen here. At the same time, the constant churn of components and the risk of a sudden victory keep you feeling like every battle matters. And the way the city and your forces disintegrate around you packs an increasingly potent emotional punch as the campaign goes on. When you’re done it’s easy to reset the game ready to do it again, with a high likelihood you’ll see different scenarios.;For more, check out our picks for the best board games for couples, the best campaign board games, and the best Star Wars board games.\", 'This isn’t just a reskin.

The core gameplay of exciting tactical encounters wrapped in a lightweight layer of strategic deck management is very much the same. The good news is that those attracted to this series for the first or second time thanks to that sci-fi makeover will discover that that core gameplay is fantastic, a seamless blend of layers that even manages to conjure theme and narrative from its simple rules.

It’s an impressive achievement to have squeezed this much originality out of an old series, and you suspect this dynamic design duo will have more tricks up their sleeve to propel it even further into the future.', 'Those playing this series for the first or second time thanks to that sci-fi makeover will discover that that core gameplay is fantastic, a seamless blend of layers that even manages to conjure theme and narrative from its simple rules.', 'Undaunted: Normandy was a surprise smash hit back in 2019 thanks to its novel marriage of building a deck of action cards in-game that you then played to command squads of soldiers on a board. It spawned several spin-offs with the same World War II theme, including the aerial Undaunted: Battle of Britain and the stupendous campaign version Undaunted: Stalingrad. (Those games are so exceptional, by the way, they landed on our lists of the best war board games and best deck-building games.);However, right back to the original, some players who were uncomfortable reducing real-life conflict to a game wanted a sci-fi version. Now their wish has been granted, as the same systems have been ported to the fight for an icy, mineral-rich moon between miners and their corporate overlords in Undaunted 2200: Callisto;Undaunted 2200: Callisto arrives in a very heavy box, and those familiar with the previous entries in the series may be surprised to find the weight is mostly down to four double-sided, fold-out boards, replacing the modular board tiles of the original.  While this reduces the number of maps you can fight on it is, for the most part, a positive change making setup easier and the boards better looking, with clear space demarcations and helpful information printed around the edges. The board art is suitably dark, cold and futuristic.;Some other surprises await. Alongside the 10-sided dice that the series has always used are a collection of eight- and 12-sided ones, used with one of this entry’s new rules, shooting at different elevations. This is also the first entry to contain a dedicated solo rule book, with solitaire play being available only via an expansion previously. There are also game rules and a scenario booklet which are clear and concise.;Beneath these are more familiar components. There are a couple of sheets of punch-out tokens and standees, which represent foot units and vehicles, respectively. There are also two large decks of cards, one for each faction, which you’ll use to command your troops. The art on these is detailed and atmospheric but has one problem: most of the figures depicted are in space suits, which makes them feel weirdly anonymous and identikit, despite efforts being made to visually differentiate the two factions. This, alongside the black-on-yellow and white-on-blue of the counters, can also make it a little awkward to tell at a glance exactly what unit under your command is what.;The core gameplay remains unchanged, so veterans of the series can dive right in. Each scenario gives you a list of cards for your starting deck, and a bigger pool of cards you can incorporate into your deck during play. At the start of each turn, both players draw four cards and pick one to bid for initiative, with more powerful cards having a higher bid value. Going first can have a huge impact on how the turn unfolds, and the loser’s card is wasted, so this is a rapidly repeating dose of tension.;Your other cards can be a mix of combat and command cards. Playing the former allows you to activate the corresponding counters on the board to do things like move and attack. The latter let you either choose new cards to add to your deck, or sometimes to draw more cards or re-activate units for a second action in the same turn. How you choose to use command cards is a fascinating strategic puzzle that depends on the scenario and the state of your forces. The more cards you add, the slower your deck will cycle and the less likely it is you’ll get complementary cards in your draw, but it also gives units more staying power in a game where eliminating enemies is often a victory condition.;When it comes to activating troops, you can’t just rush for objective spaces, or into combat with foes. Before most counters can reach a space, it has to be marked as scouted, which is the preserve of cards with the matching action, generally recon and navigation units. Once scouted, heavier units can move in and use an action to control the space, which is the other key victory condition in most scenarios. This sets up a constant stress over how to most effectively move and utilize the forces at your disposal. Each space has a defensive bonus, and the need to scout often leaves counters in vulnerable positions before they can creep into safely. Similarly, you often want your soldiers to be attacking, not spending precious actions to take control of spaces.;Most of the new game aspects add pieces to this tactical puzzle. Most noteworthy is a simple elevation system, where clearly marked spaces and platforms are treated as one level above standard spaces. Firing up a space means you’re rolling an eight-sided dice against the target number of the counter’s defense, plus the range, plus the bonus printed on the space they’re in. Firing down gets you a 12-sided dice, whereas the same elevation uses 10-sided dice. When target numbers are generally six or more, that variation makes a huge difference, meaning the fight over elevated spaces can be vicious, diverting your attention away from the objective spaces that can win you the game.;The other major change is the addition of space-specific actions, which are also printed on the board. Most commonly these are doors which you can spend an action to open, or to attack, removing them permanently, although some scenarios have laser turret spaces you can use to make a powerful attack. Between these action spaces and the elevation rules, Undaunted 2200: Callisto answers another common request from fans of the series for more interactive terrain rules. Like everything else in the game, the designer’s solution is streamlined yet effective, adding variety and depth to play with minimal extra rules overhead.;Vehicles are another example of this thought process at work. They have a shield printed round their defensive values, which essentially means they’re immune to small-arms fire. Some attack options have values to use against soft foot units, while others can attack these armored targets: often the ranges and values are different. A mining Ripper unit, their standard troop, rolls one die at any range against soft targets, but gets two dice against armored targets in the same hex, for example. Vehicle units can be very powerful, not only in terms of firepower but also flexibility, and so become yet another move in the interlocking circles of prioritization that bedevil all your choices in this game.;Units also get plenty of variety. In addition to the standard scouts, solider and machine-gunners that you meet in the first scenario, later units add additional effects such as area attacks and suppressing fire, or the ability to transport other troops with them for fast deployment. It’s also noteworthy that there’s more asymmetry in the units available to both sides than there were in earlier Undaunted games. The scouts available to the corporate player, for instance, move faster but have more limited attack options compared to their mining counterparts. This minor asymmetry is a welcome addition, making trying out each side in a scenario a much more interesting prospect.;Despite the sci-fi trappings, and the presence of mechs and laser turrets, this still feels like a pre-modern skirmish game. There are no awesomely powerful sci-fi weapons to leverage on either side, no cool technologies to harness, just re-themed rifles and machine guns. This, of course, betrays the roots of the game in World War Two. It doesn’t really spoil the game – getting up close and personal enhances the tactical options available, and you could make the same arguments about perhaps the most popular sci-fi tabletop game around, Warhammer 40k – but some players may find it disappointing.;The solo version plays well, although the overhead in following simple flowcharts for each unit, specific to each scenario, is a bit of a pain. The payoff is a mute enemy that makes tactically sensible choices, often offering clues as to the best way to approach any given scenario. There’s also a new team game for four which works surprisingly well, in which the troops on each side are subdivided into two decks, with teammates swapping the lead role in bidding for initiative each time. Splitting forces like this makes the chances of piecing together combos you might need in any given turn less likely, can be frustrating but also very exciting, and leads to emergent co-operative decision-making.', 'Undaunted 2200: Callisto answers another common request from fans for more interactive terrain rules')\n",

Those who only want to game for thrills and spills need not apply, but for anyone else, this is an easy recommendation. And in a market dominated by high production value games with complex, interlocking rule sets, it’s great to have an older master designer remind us that in board games less can still be more.', 'Like a chameleon, Cascadero differs depending on player count and variant, meaning there’s a whole lot of game to enjoy in this deceptively slimline box.', 'Dr. Reiner Knizia might not be a household name, but it’s one of the most recognizable monikers in board gaming, thanks to his astonishingly prolific career, peppered with highly acclaimed titles like auction classic Ra, heavyweight tile-layer Tigris & Euphrates and other great board games for adults. In recent years, the good doctor has slowed the pace of hits a little, but he still pops up with the goods from time to time, such as 2021’s Witchstone. Cascadero is his newest fare, and the big question is whether it’ll measure up to those big Knizia titles of yesteryear.;Cascadero comes in a worryingly slimline box, but the rich and vibrant cover art by Ian O’Toole, depicting a medieval messenger on a rearing horse, should allay any concerns about the quality of the contents. And once that lid slides off, any lingering doubts should vanish as the tray is packed with high-quality goodies.;There’s a bright fold-out, double-sided board with artwork to match the box cover, and a sheet of plain punch-out hex counters which is used on one of that board’s sides to play a variant. Some people might find the mix of vibrant player colors and muted background a little garish and others might find it affects readability a little, but these are minor complaints.;The rest of the components are wooden. Each of four player colors comes with a troop of little figures on horseback, and a bunting of flags to mark scoring achievements on the board. There’s also a bag of fake wax seals, resplendent in red and gold. Everything is neat, and nicely cut, and while it won’t win over folk who want legions of super-detailed miniatures on their tables, it’s great visual design in the European gaming tradition.;Like most Knizia titles, Cascadero has a theme that can rapidly be tossed aside to reveal an engaging semi-abstract design beneath. In this instance, you are placing messengers onto a hex grid studded with towns, trying to win the inhabitants over to the glorious reign of El Cascadero, the new ruler. But the townsfolk are suspicious, and will only listen to messengers who travel in groups. In game terms, this means that you get to score if you place a messenger piece next to a town, and it forms a group of at least two pieces of your color.;But there’s a catch. You can only score if it’s not only a group of two, but also if no other members of that group were adjacent to that town before. In other words, if you place one piece next to a town, it does nothing and if you then place a second piece next to the same town, it still does nothing. The initial piece of your group can’t be adjacent to the town you want to score.;While there are obvious reasons for this – it’d be impossible to track whether you’d scored a town before, otherwise – it also offers the first deliciously painful edge to dig into your decision-making. That board is pretty cramped. Aside for a few edge hexes, it’s hard to put a piece down that’s not immediately adjacent to a town, and that in itself is inefficient as you can’t then score it, only use it as a launchpad for neighboring towns.;Why is this important? Because the towns come in different colors, and scoring one will advance your token on the matching scoring track. The number of spaces you climb depends on the situation. One space if it’s the first piece to make contact with the town, two if there are other messengers already adjacent to the town and three if the town contains a herald, marked on the board by a star icon. Four of the scoring tracks offer the same bonuses, while the fifth, white, has extra goodies to snaffle. The catch is that you need to advance the track that matches your player color to the top space in order to be in with a chance of winning.;Remember how that board is cramped? Well, now you have additional dilemmas in deciding where to place your one precious piece each turn. Because you get a bonus space on the scoring track if there’s already a messenger adjacent to the town, pieces you put down that don’t score yourself aren’t merely inefficient, they’re a positive boon to your opponents. Not only that, but all of you will be champing at the bit to claim scarce territory around those herald towns, and those of your own player color, and so it’s a race to get them, but it’s also a race where every step gifts your enemies with possible scoring opportunities, while you try and digest this endless stack of problems and your eyes turn to saucers just thinking about it.;Yet there’s more. Moving up a scoring track doesn’t necessarily score you any points. There are other bonuses to net on your climb, from extra turns, to extra spaces on the track, to moving one of your pieces to a new board space. You can also gain seals, which are extremely useful as they allow a single piece to count as two, meaning you can score a town with one placement. But you can only get these if you land exactly on the matching space, not if you skip up by two or three, adding another headache to deal with as you plot your moves.;You might imagine that the dynamic, interactive nature of play, where you’re all jostling for position while trying not to let each other score, would make this chiefly a game of tactics rather than a strategy board game. But thanks to those bonuses on the scoring track, that’s not the case. When you gain extra on-board moves or on-track spaces, if you’re well set up, it can trigger a cascade of scoring opportunities as one advancement earns a free one, which earns a free move, which earns another free advancement and so on. These chains can be absolutely devastating if you’ve planned and timed it right, letting you bag a majority of those precious seals, or score the big points by closing off an achievement.;That’s right: while you can earn points on the tracks, the bigger payouts are available for being the first to reach certain milestones, such as connecting all five colors of town with a single group, or being the first to the top of a given track. There are less high-pressure goals for connecting two matching color towns with a group, which anyone can earn at any time, with a fat ten points extra if you do this with all five colors. But remember: unless you reach the top of your own color scoring track, it doesn’t matter how many points you have as the victory will go to the high-scoring player who has, making denial of scoring opportunities a valid and punishing end game strategy.;All this goodness, and we haven’t even mentioned the included variants. The advanced version allows you to move those important heralds each time they’re scored, creating an even more pressured race environment as you look to corner those bonuses for yourself. And there’s the farmer variant, where you flip the board, replacing some cities with a random placement of farmer tiles that earn you similar rewards to the scoring tracks. This results in a much more varied and cerebral experience. The striking thing is that each of the three ways to play is clearly the same game, but each feels like it has its own style and approach, offering three distinct challenges to master.', 'All this goodness, and we haven’t even mentioned the included variants')\n",

There’s more than enough novelty here to thrill fans of the franchise without overwhelming less dedicated players, although if you want in, you’ll need to commit to the campaign’s duration. Total neophytes or casual players have plenty of other Ticket to Ride games to choose from, but if you can find the time for twelve games, the tricks and treats in this box will repay your dedication handsomely.', 'For the most part, Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West is a triumphant new turn on an aging series, proving there’s good mileage in this old rolling stock yet.', \"Ticket to Ride is a phenomenon. The original board game achieved the unthinkable, breaking out of nerd space and into the almost unassailable world of family board game fun and supermarket shelves, selling millions of copies in the process. Along the way, it’s spawned a whole host of different versions and expansions, becoming a mini-industry in its own right. This latest iteration, Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West is a whole new spin on the classic board game, creating a campaign of rail building which lasts across twelve games, with changes from the previous game carrying on into the next.;Ticket to Ride: Legends of the West comes in a truly massive box, especially compared to previous Ticket to Ride games. Sadly, we’re not allowed to tell you very much about the contents because most of it is closed away in individual boxes which you open as you progress through the game. We’re going to try and avoid spoilers in this review, although there might be one or two very minor ones for your first play, so we’re not going to talk about what’s inside.;What you are allowed to open and sort will be familiar to fans of the series. There are bags of plastic trains in five different colors, each with its own design. There are decks of ticket and train cards with all-new art, which you separate and file with dividers in a supplied box that lets you store new components as they’re revealed. The graphic design on all the components fits in with the classic Ticket to Ride look and feel while giving it a fresh, Western-themed twist.;Other aspects are fresh, even to veteran players. The board isn’t fold-out any more, but a jigsaw affair that you piece together, allowing you to add pieces as your rail lines extend out into the frontiers of the wild west. There’s also a whole new deck called postcards, which are a key engine in adding new aspects to the game as you play through, although how they work isn’t explained until the end of your first session.;The core gameplay loop of Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West will be familiar to fans of the franchise and easy enough to be a board game for kids. On most of your turns you’ll be collecting colored train cards either blind from the deck or from a face-up selection. Your aim is to get a set that matches the colour and length of a train route printed on the board, which you can then claim by playing the cards and putting your colored plastic train pieces down on the spaces. The final action is to take tickets, cards which you hold in secret, and indicate cities on the board that you’ll want to connect with routes to earn bonus points. Failing to connect the cities on one of your tickets means you lose the points rather than gain them.;There’s a good reason why these core concepts have remained unchanged, and that’s because they’re a brilliant, addictive mix that have sustained the series through over a dozen spin-offs and expansions. Hunting for the cards you need through the face-up and face-down selection is filled with frustration, anticipation, and joy when you find the final piece. Claiming routes is always thrilling, as you wait to see if one of the other players will sneak in before you, forcing you to try and route around. Spotting someone else’s likely destination and blocking them on purpose is supremely satisfying. It’s a family-weight tactical delight, full of excitement and skill in equal measure, and it's as fun here as it's ever been.;Of course, given the radical nature of changing the formula into a campaign game, there are lots of new aspects to explore. You now earn money rather than points and there are no default dollars in claiming routes like the original. Instead, you get two dollars for claiming a route that matches your player color, and a bonus card if one of the cities connected has a large city icon. The number of train pieces you play with starts small and increases as the campaign goes on. The train deck has several newspaper cards in it that mean an event is revealed when drawn, with effects like offering a small bonus to players who’ve completed tickets early. Learning and anticipating possible events provides a minor extra strategic game plank to the play.;However, the main engines of novelty here are the story and postcard decks. The former contains cards that are read at before and after each game in the series, offering a rather silly, faux-historical narrative framework to enjoy and sometimes some new rules to incorporate. Postcards can be collected after the first game by completing certain tickets, giving an additional frisson to players who manage to finish, or to fail, those tickets. Each postcard offers a reward to its owner for achieving its listed objective. These objectives sometimes tie in with mechanics not yet revealed by the story deck, which can get marginally confusing.;As the campaign progresses, some new elements also introduce additional mechanics and mini-games for the players to compete in. We’re not going to offer any more detail for fear of spoilers, but suffice to say that these are hugely imaginative and enjoyable, offering all sorts of clever twists and turns on the core concepts of the series while not overwhelming players with new rules. Some are more tactical or strategic than others, but they’re all great fun. The mini-games offer you new ways to score points, some of which are independent of the main board, while others will change that board permanently and impact future games. All of them are a delight to open and explore, giving a thrill of anticipation to each new element.;As you might be beginning to glean, completing the campaign is central to Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West. At the beginning you're given a box in your player color in which you store components you need to keep between games and also a scoresheet to record your profits at the end of each play. When you’ve completed 12 games, you add up those profits, plus extras from mini-games and stored cards, to find an overall winner. This ultimate thrill comes with a price, however, which is that it’s unsatisfying for players to drop in and out between sessions if they can’t make it. There are rules to cover this, but they’re a little awkward, and you’ll get the most out of your campaign if the same group of players can be present at every game.;The original legacy campaign game, based on Risk, felt daringly transgressive with its instructions to tear up cards and scrawl on the board. The fashion has moved on to more “resettable” campaigns, but Ticket to Ride: Legacy sees you making permanent changes, resulting in a version of the game that’s unique to you. While it’s good to see this back, those changes feel less personal than they did in the earliest legacy games, and some of the mini-games are gone forever once they’re over. So it’s questionable how often your group might continue playing once the twelve games are up.;For more, check out our roundups of the best board games for parties, the best board games for 5-year olds, and the best cheap board games.\", 'It’s a family-weight tactical delight, full of excitement and skill in equal measure')\n",

Its sheer weight and the glory of the game that came before it holds it back. If you’re a Gloomhaven fan but you haven’t yet finished working your way through that behemoth of a box it’s better to stick with what you know for now rather than start a new project. If you’re new to the entire franchise then you should absolutely jump into that brilliant combat and exploration engine but the cut-down Jaws of the Lion is a better introduction. If you’re one of the rare few who not only have seen everything Gloomhaven has to offer but also remain hungry for more, however, Frosthaven is the banquet to satiate you. Bigger, bolder and better than the original, if you can find time for it in your life it’s an epic gaming experience like no other.', 'Bigger, bolder and better than the original, Frosthaven is an epic gaming experience like no other -- if you can find room for it in your life, that is.', 'Gloomhaven was big in every sense of the word, a physically imposing cooperative dungeon crawl campaign that raised nearly thirteen million dollars on Kickstarter and changed the face of gaming. When it hit the shelves it was a critical darling, pulling in high review scores and encouraging players to work all the way through its two-hundred-odd hours of play. It spawned a much more compact prequel, Jaws of the Lion, and yet still the fan base wanted more. Now, after another thirteen million dollar Kickstarter, they’ve got it with an Arctic-themed full sequel, Frosthaven and another few hundred hours of dungeon-delving board game delight.;If Gloomhaven was big enough to exert its own gravity on the hobby as a whole, Frosthaven is even bigger. It’s so big that the simple drag factor of the 10-inch-deep lid against the box sides makes opening it a non-trivial task, like levering open the rusty hinges of a treasure chest.;When you’ve won that struggle, the first bauble you’ll encounter is a four-page manual on how to sort and organise the mountain of cardboard and plastic packed inside. Beneath that is the actual rulebook, which is so thick it needs to be softbound. This is to say nothing of the scenario and section books, the latter of which contains story text paragraphs, both of which require spiral binding.;The sheer amount of stuff here boggles the mind. There are sheets upon sheets of chits and standees to punch and organise into supplied storage trays and bags. There are decks and decks of cards which sit in slots, separated by dividers, in trays at the bottom of the box. There’s a map board with stickers to mark your exploration, character sheets, tracking dials and lots of mysteriously sealed envelopes of secrets.;Most intriguing of all is the row of symbol-marked sub-boxes within the main box. These are character boxes and they come in pairs with a matching symbol: one contains the character’s miniature and the other their decks of cards, chits and character details. You get access to six of these, of varying complexity, at the start of the game and have to earn the right to open the remainder as you progress.;While that spiral-bound rulebook will look daunting for newcomers, veterans of either of the previous war board games will find most of the core systems intact. The most critical of these is its card-based approach to combat. Each player’s character has a unique class and comes with its own deck of cards detailing the special powers, spells and combat moves it has access to. These are divided into two halves, with a different effect on each and a number in the middle. On your turn, you must pick two to play getting the upper effect from one, the lower effect from the other, and using either number as your initiative value for the turn.;This makes planning your turn an absolute tactical minefield. The upper and lower effects are arranged in such a way that it’s very hard, in most cases, to attack twice, or to chain your most powerful abilities together. In the rare instances where this is possible your initiative will almost certainly suffer.;Movement and melee against monsters on the tight corridors of the grid-based maps are taut and dangerous. On almost every turn you’ll be torn between fighting enemies, helping friends or advancing your scenario goals. Trying to choose the right cards for the right circumstances is a pain so keen that it becomes a pleasure. All the more so when you lose cards for each cycle through the deck, a screw slowly tightening with every wasted action and another impossible decision point to face down.;To make the cooperative aspect more interesting, players are only allowed to talk about their plans in general terms, not using specific numbers. Players also have random secret goals for each scenario, a longer-term quest which they can keep public or private as they wish. Players are also not supposed to share treasure, only keeping what they’ve looted, crafted or bought themselves. All this conspires alongside the game’s gnarly tactical engine to stop any one player from dominating the game and bossing others around. Everyone has their own objectives and will have to balance those with the needs of the group.;Trying to prevent you from achieving either is the horde of monsters queuing down every corridor and behind each door to tear you apart. There are dozens of different types, each with its own simple AI deck to govern their behavior, including an initiative value for when they act. Most of them are ruthless and armed with a wide variety of special abilities like poison and paralysis to stack misery upon the misery of them ripping you to bits in combat. To stop combat from becoming predictable, Frosthaven uses combat modifier decks instead of dice so you get a mix of possibilities without any wild swings.;Most of this is essentially the same as it was in Gloomhaven, bar a few clarifications and improvements to speed things along, plus plenty of all-new characters. And it’s also much the same between scenarios. There are still events to draw on your way to a dungeon and events to draw afterwards, although they’re now divided by season. You will still also get the chance to spend your gold on useful items and spend your experience on improving the ability and modifier decks for your character. You’ll still find yourself on an absorbing, branching narrative of scenarios with somewhat more engaging writing. It’s all still great, helping you feel part of a living world while offering an array of strategic options to play with. What’s really new is the town of Frosthaven itself.;Frosthaven, the town that is, has its own board and even its own character sheet. It serves as your base between adventures and you can use buildings there to do various things advantageous to your party. Early on, for example, you’ll get the chance to craft items and potions from resources found on your quests. As time goes on you can use those same resources to add new buildings to the town and upgrade the ones you have, increasing your options and capabilities. You’ll also be responsible for its defenses, which are called into play as part of frequent attack events which risk your hard-earned constructions being damaged or destroyed.;It’s a fantastic addition. Not only does it give you more strategic options to play with and more motivation to dig through dungeons looking for loot but, because you created it, you become invested in it over time. In both Gloomhaven and Frosthaven, the characters you play will retire over time to be replaced by new ones. And while that adds variety and excitement to proceedings, it interferes with the bond between player and character that you want to foster in a role-playing-style board game. The town becomes a surrogate for that sense of attachment. It becomes your baby, something you want to work to improve and staunchly defend against harm.;Of course, the town, like everything else in this massive game, requires a host of components to maintain. Playing the game entirely analogue, as written, with its overflowing inventory of chits, cards and characters is a colossal amount of overhead. Fortunately, there are various digital assistants you can employ instead which makes things easier. But no app can take the donkey work out of searching the box for the tiles you need to construct the map, or the monster standees to put on it. Nor can it help you remember what on earth is going on if you walk away for a fortnight and forget.

It’s a dichotomy that bears some really quite bizarre fruit, with some players claiming it represents various sociological theories of power and oppression. Whether you want to get quite that deep into its verdant glades is up to you: many will find its long learning curve too off-putting to even get close. But the fact that some players can, and do, think about the game in such detail stands as a testament to just how compellingly unusual and exciting Root can be.', 'Root works because it is at once familiar and novel: a wargame with a cutesy theme disguising a highly asymmetric strategy affair.', 'Root belongs to a small but burgeoning subgenre of tabletop board games where players immerse themselves in the woodland worlds of mice, racoons and other wild critters. For the most part, these are adventure-style games, heavy on narrative detail. But Root is different: behind its endearing exterior is a challenging conflict game in which four factions clash for control of their forest home. This really is nature red in tooth and claw.;While Root comes in a relatively small box, it’s heavy with content. There are three rulebooks: a quick-start walkthrough, a more verbose guide to the game in the box, and a full bullet-pointed rulebook which includes details for the game’s many expansions. There are four different player boards, one for each faction, and the board itself which is double-sided and so offers two different maps to play on.;Beneath all that cardboard are the game’s compellingly cute components. First, a stack of cards illustrated in the unique, striking style of Kyle Ferrin: he’s also responsible for the board and box art but it’s on the cards that he truly shines, with characters and scenes in pen and ink that somehow manage to be both adorable and deadly serious at the same time.;That dichotomy is also captured by the bag of screen-printed pawns which use simple eyes-and-nose features in an astonishingly characterful way. There are three piles of pawns for the cats, birds, and woodland critters in the game plus a single fourth pawn, which evokes a racoon, for the vagabond. Some punch-out tokens and a pair of custom 12-sided dice, printed with 0-3 three times over, round out the contents.;At first glance, Root looks like a typical game of conflict and territory, where players are fighting to control portions of a map. And in some respects, it’s exactly that. But it’s far more novel than it may appear because it’s a highly asymmetric game. Each player controls a faction which not only has a few special powers as you might see in a typical game of this style, but that essentially plays the game by its own, distinct rules. This takes some getting used to -- hence the helpful quick-start guide -- but the results are sublime.;There are a few shared concepts that all the factions use. Players get cards each turn which must be “crafted” in order to be played or which can be discarded to fuel certain effects. Everyone uses the same movement, control and combat system, which involves moving between board spaces and rolling two custom dice with the values 0 to 3. The attacker gets to use the highest dice and the result is the number of casualties inflicted on the enemy. Even this takes some getting used to but it’s an interesting concept for a dice-rolling board game that really rewards aggression.;Beyond this, the factions diversify. The cats are the closest to a standard wargame, with a pool of actions they can use to build, move and attack, and they get points for defeating enemies and creating their own structures. The birds are also a conquest-based faction but they play very differently. Their faction has a “decree” which indicates they must take certain actions in certain spaces, and you must add to the decree each turn. This can give them a huge pool of actions but if you fail to meet the dictates of the decree the result is disastrous, losing you points and forcing you to start a new decree from scratch.;Pitting the cats against the birds is the recommended setup for a two-player game, and it makes for a fascinating face-off. On the one side, you have the familiar cats, seeking to gain territory and resources as they amass forces and creep across the map securing territory. On the other you have the birds, gathering speed and strength with each passing turn like some demented clockwork toy before crashing and starting over. The bird player must carefully plan his decree to make it achievable for as long as possible, while the cats balance their need for consolidation against the desire to mess up that decree by ensuring the birds can’t take the necessary actions.;The other two factions are even more peculiar. The Woodland Alliance is essentially an underground guerilla army made up of the disaffected critter peasantry. They can sacrifice cards to buy sympathy in a clearing which can, later, blossom into a revolt, destroying enemy forces there and adding the Alliance’s own troops from their limited pool. Once established, incursions by other players into Alliance territory cause outrage, bolstering their cause despite the military setbacks. It’s the dilemma faced by all powers struggling with insurgencies in microcosm, and it brings engrossing new dimensions to the strategy to see it portrayed in a relatively accessible manner alongside the clash of more regular forces.;Our final faction is the Vagabond, a lone piece that plays more like a role-playing character, accumulating gear to build actions, than any kind of military force. They have the most complex rules and the most fluid palette of point-scoring. They can prosper by exploring old ruins and completing quests then, later in the game, will become friends or enemies with other factions in the game, scoring additional points by trading or attacking them respectively. Playing the Vagabond is a careful balancing act of predicting how the game will ebb and flow so you can support and annoy the right people while leaving yourself space to pursue individual goals.;Root really shines with all four players. The military clashes between the birds and cats set the stage, while the Woodland Alliance and the Vagabond hide behind the curtain, trying to furtively pull together points. This dynamic feels very unusual, with the two armies fighting in a zero-sum game of tearing strips off each other while always looking over their shoulder lest they outrage alliance supporters or earn the enmity of the Vagabond. The result is a game that feels like a war board game, but one where the negotiation over alliances takes a back seat, letting mechanical strategy shine through without reducing player interaction, and earns a spot on our list of the best board games for adults.;Getting to the point where you can fully enjoy the game, however, takes some effort. Learning one faction is fine, but you really need to know the rules for all the factions to plan your strategy well. To properly grasp things you ideally need to play all the factions, more than once, so you can understand the problems from the inside. And while the asymmetry in Root is fascinating it can also lead to some unfortunate games in which each faction feels like it’s doing its own thing, and a leader can coast to victory without the other players being able to do much about it.;For more like this, check out our picks for the best board games for couples, the best roll-and-write board games, and the best campaign board games.', 'Root is far more novel than it may appear because it’s a highly asymmetric game')\n",

It’s an excellent game in its own right, thrilling, tactical, and tactically thrilling - and capable of recreating all the drama of a real sports match.

It may prove too lightweight for the most serious gamers, but anyone else should grab the beer and the chicken wings, switch off the TV, and bring a whole new meaning to the term “fantasy football” on their tabletops with this.', \"Tighter and better balanced than its predecessors, Blitz Bowl is an excellent game. It's thrilling, tactical, and tactically thrilling -- fully capable of recreating all the drama of a real sports match.\", \"Back in 1986, designer Jervis Johnson had the bright idea of making a fantasy sports board game based on American Football, but with no-holds-barred violence. That game became Blood Bowl, and its mixture of strategy, comedy and brutality has sustained it through multiple editions into the present day. But despite its breakneck premise, it’s actually quite a ponderous game that takes a while to learn and play. Enter Blitz Bowl, a much smaller, faster 2-player board game based on the same idea although mechanically it’s very different from its big sibling. Blitz Bowl: Ultimate Edition is the third edition, but can it live up to its ultimate billing?;This being a Games Workshop game, one of the primary draws are the plastic miniatures included. They compose two teams of six players each: some heroic humans and the devious, rat-like Skaven. As we’ve come to expect from the publisher the figures are top-notch, giddy with detail and dynamism. The Skaven, however, are quite fragile and even experienced modellers may break a tail or two during assembly. Care and a very sharp craft knife are needed.;Along with the figures, there are some plastic footballs and a coin and a scoring marker for each team. The play takes place on a double-sided game board, giving you a choice of pitches with various obstacles to play around. One side has a single starting space for the ball, while the other has two: a dice roll determines which one the ball pops out of.;Rounding out the contents is a deck of cards, some custom dice, a range ruler and a stat card for each team you can field in the game. This extends way beyond the two included across the whole Games Workshop universe, running from Orcs to Ogres. You can buy extra teams of six for some factions, for others you’ll have to buy the full twelve of a Blood Bowl team and choose the six you want to use. All the cards are decent quality and decorated either with solid art or photos of painted miniatures.;On your turn, you can take three actions, split between your players as you see fit, as long as no one model takes the same action twice. The actions available to you depend on whether the figure is “marked” - that is, has an opposing model in an adjacent square - or not. Unmarked figures are free to run, throw the ball or make a short two-square movement to mark an opponent. Marked figures can only attack an opposing team member, which requires a dice roll, or step a single square away.;If you read that carefully, you’ll realize that this means running players can’t move into squares next to opposing team members. It also means that it often takes all three of your actions in a turn to attack an enemy: a run to cover the group, a mark to move adjacent and finally the block action to undertake the attack. These two aspects are critical to the strategy and action economy of the game. You need to spread your players out among the pitch scenery to try and stop runs into your end zone, which scores points. You also need to be careful with your tackles because if you fail, you’re open to a one-action tackle in return.;Players who manage to score a goal by carrying the ball into the opposing end zone win their team four points and are taken off the pitch in the celebrations. It takes a special reserve action to get them back on, the same as players who are injured in a tackle. But there’s no pitch reset: a new ball pops up in the middle and play continues even though you’re a player or more down. At first, this can lead to a lot of end-to-end dashes, especially when a lot of players are off injured or celebrating. With experience, you’ll learn to hang back, cobble together a defensive line, and make more strategic plays.;Goals are not the only source of points in Blitz Bowl, however. There are always three cards next to the board that will get you from zero to three bonus points for completing particular actions. Injuring an opponent, say, or completing a risky pass. What’s the point of a card worth zero, you might ask? Because in addition to the points, the cards also have a playable effect on the reverse. That might be a dice reroll or even an extra action. So winning one is a double whammy improving both your score and your options. These cards are also the game timer: when they run out, the game ends.;Between them, positional play, card management and dice rolling hit a beautiful sweet spot amid strategy, tactics and the excitement of random dice rolling. This is very much a board game for couples that rewards good play, whether that’s planning to keep your scrimmage line together or working out ways to snaffle cards alongside moving the ball forward. At the same time, it’s also a game that rewards venturseome decisions that lead to thrilling moments, whether that’s putting the boot in to down a defender or chaining cards during a last-ditch dash to the goal line. And it only takes an hour or so to play, too.;In this respect, Blitz Bowl is actually better at recreating the feel of a sports game than its big brother Blood Bowl. With a full complement of twelve players and more complex “turnover” mechanics, the latter takes longer over each turn and longer to play overall. It feels more like a chess match with dice than any kind of ballgame. Blitz Bowl, by contrast, is lean and exciting, packed with last-minute gambles and matches that go down to the last field goal, just as you want the very best football games to feel.;Owners of one or both previous editions of the game may be wondering what’s new here. Especially since it’s the same human team we’ve seen both those boxes, making this feel a little samey. The good news is that the changes are almost all positive, thanks partly to the unusual step of involving the fanbase in the design via The Crush podcast. The rules are mostly the same but with a few rough edges smoothed out. There are new stats for all the teams which should help balance issues. And finally, the card deck has undergone a complete overall to encourage more dynamic, aggressive play.;Want more?

Even undisputed classic board games of this genre like Fury of Dracula and Specter Ops suffer these issues to some degree.;None of this has stopped designers from trying, though, because piecing together clues as you chase the suspect is such fun. The latest game to try is Mind MGMT, a title inspired by a comic book of the same name (see it on Amazon) about a shadowy psychic spy network. One player is the recruiter, looking for talent to join the organization. The others are rogue agents, trying to track them down.;As a game based on a graphic novel, everything from the board to the box itself uses art from the comic. The watercolor art of its author, Matt Kindt, is distinctive and not to everyone’s taste, but there’s no denying it gives the game a unique look. While it leaves some components, such as the gridded board, looking a bit sparse, others stand out, like the surreal feature cards.;For the hidden player, there’s a wipe-clean copy of the board to track their movement and a screen to hide it behind. There’s a whiteboard marker too for both sides to use, as some of the tokens used by the rogue agents can be written on to make notes. Both sides have some cardboard standees of head art from the comics to move on the board.;That sounds like a poor haul of components to have in the very large and awkward box the game arrives in. The rest of the space is taken up by fourteen sealed tuck boxes, seven for each side, which won’t be part of your first play. We’ll return to these mysterious items later.;With one side hiding and the other hunting, the rules for the two factions are quite different. Indeed, the rulebook looks daunting with its cramped text and colored boxes for optional rules. In fact, the core framework isn’t that hard: there are introductory and advanced rule sets explained together in one booklet, which make it feel confusing.;Play starts with the hidden recruiter declaring their start space and then making five moves in secret. They’re not allowed to revisit a space they’ve been in. Behind their screen, they will have three feature cards that correspond to icons on the board: there are two features in most spaces. To gain recruits and ultimately win the game, they have to visit these features and record the growing tally of their recruits in public.;After that, the game begins in earnest as the rogue agents can start to search for the recruiter. There are four agents and on their turn, each can move two spaces and take an action. The most common one is to ask the recruiter about a feature in the agent’s space. If the recruiter has ever visited a space with that feature they must place a footstep token on the board in any one such space.;Another key action the agents have is the reveal, which they can use in a space with a footstep token. The recruiter must then reveal when they were in that space, a critical clue since it lets the agents know how far away the recruit is. However, it takes two agent actions in the same space, first the ask, then the reveal, to get this information, by which time the recruiter can be several spaces away.;These are the parameters of the puzzle, and what a wonderful puzzle it is, slowly coalescing for the hunters while the hunted does their best to misdirect and escape the closing jaws. Based on the time, the clues and deductions about what features the recruiter is visiting, the agents must try and piece together where the recruiter is headed, then get to the right space and make a capture action. Mind MGMT provides just the right drip-feed of data to keep everyone engrossed, discussing details and ratcheting up the tension as time ticks on.;Meanwhile, the recruiter is scheming to slip the net and win either by collecting enough recruits or running the time down. As well as being mealy-mouthed with their replies to ask actions they have other tricks up their sleeves. They can make a single two-space move during the course of play, telling the agents they have done so, and can also move diagonally through spaces with no features. It may not sound like a lot, but it’s more than enough to give the agents the runaround and satisfy the voyeur’s itch that makes hidden movement so compelling.;By themselves, these parameters would shape an enjoyable game. But Mind MGMT goes further and dismantles the barriers built in to hidden movement. It’s fast, for starters, wrapping up in an hour or so. And the pace is quick, with the four agent turns each round interspersed with two for the recruiters to sustain interest. The hidden map and the way clues are dispensed make it hard to give inaccurate information by accident but if it happens, there’s even a rule to help rebalance the game. It’s a great package and earned a spot on our list of the best board games for adults;However, this is just the introductory game. The full ruleset adds a number of fascinating wrinkles. Barriers to movement are added, and the agents get special powers to mimic their comic book inspirations plus an ally they can activate for an extra bonus. To compensate, the recruiter gains control of four “immortal” pawns that represent the self-healing enforcers of the agency which can block agents from taking actions and even gather recruits themselves.;The result is an extraordinary web of clue and counter-clue, woven around more traditional strategic concerns like position and action efficiency. The only thing it really seems to lack is the scope of some of its brethren which stray into things like booby traps and combat. But like the Mind MGMT agency itself, even this appearance is deceptive.;Remember those mysterious tuck boxes, keyed to either side? After your initial full game, the losing side is instructed to open their first box. Inside they’ll find a little snippet from one of the comic books and some cards and tokens that expand their options, giving them a boost for the next play. As more boxes are opened, you can pick and choose which of these extra elements you want to include in each game. We won’t spoil the contents, but it’s a wonderful way to keep the game surprising and fresh and keep you coming back for more, which is what we're looking for in the best board games.;For more, check out our picks for the best quick playing board games, the best board games for couples, and the best Marvel board games.\", 'These are the parameters of the puzzle, and what a wonderful puzzle it is')\n",

In fact, the only novel thing it brings to the table is reveal turns. But in truth its real innovation is simply in weaving all these ideas seamlessly into a single game, along with a setting. The result is impressive: a game that’s accessible, varied and with an appeal that reaches across a wide range of gaming tastes. Like a real desert, Dune: Imperium’s bland looks conceal a wealth of life and depth.', 'Dune: Imperium is an impressive game that’s accessible, varied, and has an appeal that reaches across a wide range of gaming tastes.', 'For decades, fans of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel Dune could only get their tabletop kicks from one game, also called Dune. But it was some game: released in 1979 it was years ahead of its time and encouraged players to recreate the Machiavellian scheming of the novel. However, it needed six players to shine and had a wildly variable play time.;Now there’s a new pretender to the throne in Dune: Imperium (see it on Amazon). It’s a very different beast, eschewing the classic territorial conquest setup of the old game for a mishmash of modern strategic design ideas. But with the Dune name on the box and an acclaimed new film adaptation in the cinemas, it’s well poised for success and has earned a spot on our roundup of the best board games for adults.;For all that the novels have inspired some great art down the years, Dune: Imperium opts for function over form. The board and box are awash with muted desert tones, as you might expect. Beneath, there are a lot of cards with a lot of serviceable art to illustrate them. The best bits are the portraits on the leader cards players use to indicate their allegiance.;There are wooden bits too, cubes that are both used on score tracks and to represent troops, and humanoid shapes for agents. It’s all pretty standard fare, although the player colors are bold and striking.;At the core, Dune: Imperium is a deck building board game. In these games, players start with a small deck of cards, often all players have the same deck as is the case here. As the game goes on they can buy new, more powerful cards for their deck and, with luck, remove some of the weak original ones. This game adds a novel twist to this popular formula, called “reveal turns.”;Each card has two possible effects. The first is for when you use it to add an agent piece to the board, which also gives you the effects of the space it’s played into. This draws in another well-worn gaming mechanic, worker placement. But you only have a limited pool of agents, normally two. After that, you “reveal” your remaining cards, gaining the second effect.;Most deck building games revolve around building hands that let you draw and play more cards, giving you a more powerful turn and cycling your deck faster. Reveal turns frees Dune: Imperium from the need to follow this pattern, leaving it able to do far more interesting things with its card effects and strategic options.;Players take on the role of noble houses in Dune’s setting, including the Atreides and Harkonnen from the first novel. They each have a choice of two leader cards with flavorful special powers. The other major players, the Emperor, planetary natives the Fremen and others, are represented by board spaces. Committing agents here advances your influence within these factions, a major source of victory points. The other spaces are geographical abstracts of places on the planet Dune.;Cards are keyed to one or more of these board areas and can only be played there. Many spaces also require that you spend one of the game’s three resources - water, spice, and solari - to send an agent there. Others reward you with some of those resources or troops.;In essence, then, what this does is hitch deck building to the typical resource pyramid dilemma so beloved of modern strategy games. To get resources you need resources, and the only solution to this chicken and egg problem is making better use of the cards in your hand than your opponents do. Deck-building is a brilliant adjunct to this setup, giving you another strategic lever to work with and ensuring there’s no “best” way to solve the central puzzle.;Of course, for all the scheming in the book, it’s also a story about martial prowess and Dune: Imperium hasn’t forgotten that aspect. There’s a very abstract “conflict” mechanic whereby each turn has a different reward drawn for winning a military victory. Agents played into geographic spaces allow you to push troops from your reserves into this generic conflict. When everyone’s had their reveal turns, players tot up the troops committed, with bonuses from reveal effects, and divide up the rewards according to their ranking.;Despite the awkward abstraction, this is a crucial element of the design. Like most worker-placement games, agents sent to a space block it from other players for that turn. But Dune: Imperium has a lot more spaces than most games of its ilk, meaning that blocking is often a minor inconvenience. That reduces it as a source of tension and interaction, which the conflict more than makes up for. The dribble of soldiers into the fight each turn is a slow burn battle of one-upmanship, with the result uncertain until the reveals are laid down.;Between resources, cards and the conflict players are left with a lot of plates to spin and only two measly actions to do it with. And that’s reckoning without the victory points you’ll need to win, which come from various sources. As well as faction influence they can be won in the conflict or gained from cards. The game ends when someone cracks ten victory points or ten turns pass, whichever comes first. The leading player does not always win, as a final flurry of card play can sometimes secure a bonus point or two.;In focusing on giving players a rich soup of tactical decisions, however, Dune: Imperium distances itself from its source material. A Crysknife might be a sacred weapon to the Fremen, but here it’s just pushing a cube up an influence track. The bones of a narrative are in place: the Fremen want water, spaces on Dune give you spice and the Spacing Guild will help you land a ton of troops on the planet. But it’s a weak simulacrum, an unconvincing ghola, with little of the devious plotting central to the novels.;It also really needs three or four players to shine and is easily one of the best three player games out there. The solo game offers a solid challenge and earned it a spot on our list of the best single-player board games. It pits you against two AI players which are simple to play but harder to beat as you increase their difficulty level. With two you still have to add one AI player, making for an annoying distraction the players have to administer between their own turns.;For even more gaming fun, check out our round ups of the best 90s board games, the best campaign board games, and the best cheap board games.', 'This game adds a novel twist to the popular deck-building formula, called “reveal turns.”')\n",

There’s nothing new on offer here other than the story itself, which is not a particular draw. But that’s fine: what this does instead is repackage the original in a more convenient and affordable format.\\xa0For most groups who can’t find the 100+ play hours required to finish Gloomhaven, the cut-down content is a positive advantage. One of the best and most innovative games of recent years is now within reach of anyone who wants to experience its thrills. Jaws of the Lion is proof that in board gaming, as everywhere, bigger isn’t always better.', \"Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion takes the bulky original game and downsizes it into a more manageable format that's still a blast to play.\", 'The cooperative dungeon crawler Gloomhaven turned the board game upside down when it was released in 2017. Arriving in a box the size of a shipping container for a price tag to match, it delivered an extraordinary marriage of tactical combat and RPG-style character building. It remains a top-rated board game for those with the space, money and time to devote to its considerable charms.;Now, designer Isaac Childres has created a cut-down prequel for the rest of us. Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion (see it on Amazon) attempts to cut away the bloat of the original, leaving the core experience intact and landing itself on our list of the best board games of all time. You take the role of the titular mercenary group and guide them through 25 adventures as they investigate a series of mysterious disappearances.;Jaws of the Lion comes in a much more manageable box than the original, but it still weighs as much as a treasure chest, packed with cardboard gold. Much of the weight is standees for the sixteen different types of monsters, as well as tokens for tracking stats and scenery. Clear instructions on how to keep it all organized and a handy storage tray are also included.;There are also four plastic player miniatures and matching boxes of their cards and character sheets. Another four small boxes contain surprises to uncover during the campaign. Despite these, this isn’t a “legacy” game, where you change components during play, as such. There is a sticker sheet and city map but these turn out to be eye candy, superfluous to play.;The one disappointment is the scenario book. In the original game, you had the annoyance of assembling the board for each adventure from cardboard tiles. Here, the maps come ready printed in a flip book, which is much more convenient. However, most games with similar books have durable, high-quality, glossy leaves. Jaws of the Lion opts instead for ordinary weight paper which seems likely to tear with use.;Gloomhaven is not a simple game. Jaws of the Lion uses the same system, with a few clarifications and a tiny number of options taken out. If you’re familiar with the original, you can jump right into this. If not, you have a steep learning curve ahead of you, although it helps that many rules feel quite intuitive. An immobile model cannot move, for example, and a stunned one can’t do anything.;Either way, this included playbook introduces the games’ complexity piecemeal over the first few scenarios. This is an excellent idea, and makes getting to grips with the game much more manageable. The only downside is that it does involve a bit of faff in removing “basic” versions of cards in favor of their full version as you learn new rules. Be aware that even with this great aid, you’ll still have a lot to remember in the full game.;You might ask why you’d bother taking the effort: the answer is that the tactical combat engine that powers the game is quite, quite brilliant, making it one of the best strategy board games.;Each character has its own deck that represents the actions it can take. Axe-throwing Hatchet, for example, is good at ranged attacks and looting treasure. His signature card is “the favorite” which mimics a special axe that does bonus damage but must be looted back from a dead foe to use again. Every card has an upper and lower action and an initiative value.;On your turn, you pick two to use and execute the upper effect from one, the lower effect from the other and the initiative from either. Right away, you’re in a bind, trying to juggle the most effective pairing of actions for the situation, while worrying about when you’re going to act. The monster’s initiative and actions, governed by a random card draw, won’t be clear yet. Do you dive in with an early ranged attack, risk going later and hope you’ll have the move to close for melee, or settle for a buff next turn?;This offers a fun challenge at the outset, with a boggling range of options. But as the game progresses, it turns on the thumbscrews. After each pass through the deck you lose a card permanently. Some of the more powerful cards are also one-shot. When you’re out of cards, you’re out of the game. So as you progress your options narrow, a merciless counter driving you on through each adventure. It makes every action, every choice so crucial that there’s barely time to loot the chests.;Of course, making bad choices and being killed by the monsters will also knock you out of the game. Every foe has its own stat line and deck of behavior cards. Zealots cast curses and heal themselves. Giant Vipers, meanwhile, slither quickly through difficult terrain to close in with poisonous bites. With a different monster mix in each scenario, there’s plenty of excitement and variety to keep you on your toes.;Presuming you survive, you get to upgrade your character. If you found time to stop for gold, you can spend it on items. If you gained enough experience you can level up and swap a card in your deck for a more powerful option. There are lots of choices on offer, all well balanced to make character building an interesting mini-game in its own right. The deeper you go into the dungeons, the more attached you’ll become to the plastic avatar you’ve created.;What you can’t do, though, is pool gold to get the best items. Despite its intuitive nature, Jaws of the Lion can be gamey like that. There’s no real reason why, having killed all the monsters in a scenario, you wouldn’t be able to go back and mop up the treasure, but it’s not allowed. While frustrating, this does create a fascinating tension in cooperative play. The group wants to complete the scenario, while the individual also wants to waste actions stockpiling treasure.;Moving through the campaign tells a gruesome, if linear and somewhat boilerplate, tale of dark fantasy adventure. The writing is fine and there’s a deck of random events to add flavor between scenarios. But what really keeps pushing you onward toward the conclusion isn’t the story: it’s the chance to have another tilt at that brilliant tactical combat engine, earning its way onto our list of the best board games for adults.;;For even more gaming fun, check out our picks for the best horror board games, best campaign board games, and best cheap board games.', 'The tactical combat engine that powers the game is quite, quite brilliant;With a different monster mix in each scenario, there’s plenty of excitement and variety to keep you on your toes')\n",

One caveat has to be offered to those familiar with 7 Wonders Duel, though: while the new mechanics make this a cut above that game, the two feel very similar and you can’t really justify owning both. If you’re new to this series, by the time you’re knee deep in rings and things, frantically wondering what the next card flip will be and whether you’ll be able to stop your foe one space from winning, you won’t care that much about the niceties of skill or story. You’ll be too busy having a good time.', 'Though you may want to pass if you already own 7 Wonders: Duel, The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth offers an exciting and varied new take on the original game, while still being accessible for newcomers.', \"Once upon a time there was a hugely popular card-drafting game called 7 Wonders. But drafting, where you pick a card to keep and pass the rest on, is pretty boring with two players, seeing as you know exactly what you’re going to be given on each pass. So, eventually, the game got a spin-off for two players only called 7 Wonders Duel which cleverly mimicked a draft by giving players a mixture of face-up and face-down cards to choose from. That was also hugely popular: indeed popular enough that it’s now received a shiny new Tolkien reskin in the form of Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth (see it at Amazon).;Since this is essentially a card game, that’s the majority of the box contents. Fortunately they’re great cards, vibrant with evocative Middle-earth art. Some of the art actually joins together to make panoramas – although it’s unlikely you’ll manage to collect a set during play. Cards have a colored top bar to indicate what type they are, and most also have several symbols indicating both what that card can do for you, and the prerequisites for acquiring it.;Players new to this version might be more interested in the other components, which are used for tracking the game state. There’s a mini-map of Middle-earth onto which you place delightfully tiny wooden army and castle pieces. Another lovely touch is the hunt for the ring track, over which you place a plastic slider with the hobbits at one end and a movable plastic ringwraith at the other. This ensures the hobbits can inch closer to their objective at Mount Doom, the wraith can inch closer to the hobbits, but the hobbits can never get further away from the wraith.;The remaining pieces are punchable cardboard. There are several stacks of shields, one for each of the neutral factions of Middle-earth that the players hope to ally with, featuring icons on the reverse to indicate the reward for doing so, and lots of gold coins. Finally there’s a tile for each region on the board indicating what fortress you can build there, what it costs, and what you gain for doing so.;7 Wonders: Duel simulated drafting for two by having each of its three rounds set out a pattern of cards in which a row of face-up cards overlapped a row of face-down cards. That same layout is replicated here exactly, except rather than competing civilizations, one of you is the dark lord Sauron and the other represents the free people of Middle-earth. You can’t pick a card – or flip it, if it’s face-down – until the cards beneath it in the pyramid have been cleared. This makes your choice of which card to take each turn difficult and tense, because you want to try and minimize the options available to your opponent while also maximising your own further down the line.;This card pyramid isn’t the only thing that Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth retains from its predecessor. Indeed, pretty much the entire game flow will be familiar to veterans of that game. Most early cards are free, so you can pick them up and add them to your growing tableau. But as the game progresses, more powerful cards will either require you to have particular skill icons or prerequisite symbols from cards you already own in order to take them. If you can’t afford anything, you can use gold to make up the shortfall of matching symbols or discard a card for gold instead.;You are thus quickly caught into a dilemma as to whether to specialize in certain sets of skills, which will make it easier to get similar cards, or play as more of a generalist. There’s no right answer to this: it depends on what cards you get and in what order, and learning when to break one way or the other is a key tactical skill that comes with experience. Either way, this makes flipping face-down cards surprisingly exciting because there can be a lot riding on it if it’s the next key part in the specialist chain that you’re building. There’s nothing worse than suddenly finding you’ve handed the opportunity to pick-up a critical card to your opponent because grabbing something else you wanted revealed it.;In addition to cards that grow your tableau economy, there are also cards that move you forward on victory conditions. These are where Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth makes clear water between itself and its predecessor. Ring symbols let you advance on the quest for the ring track. If either side reaches the end of its track, it’s an instant win, with identical bonuses to be had along the way. Green cards represent an alliance with another faction such as Elves or Ents: six different such symbols and you win, while duplicates get you a bonus token from a stack specific to each faction. Finally, red cards let you place armies on the map of Middle-Earth, kicking out rivals on a one-to-one basis. If you conquer all seven regions you win, otherwise the player with the most regions when the card stack runs out takes the victory.;Each victory condition is cleverly designed to close in on its apex during the third round of play. You are pretty much guaranteed to be within touching distance of one, if not two, by then and play becomes a matter not only of trying to inch yourself over the line but selecting cards that prevent your opponent from doing the same. This ensures that play builds towards a truly thrilling climax almost every time, lending the game an epic feel that belies its relative simplicity and snappy half-hour play time.;However, after a few plays it’s hard not to wonder how much of this comes down to skill, and how much of it is luck. As mentioned previously, revealing a card that either you, or your opponent, need, can be absolutely critical to which way the victory breaks and there’s very little you can do about it. The decisions you make along the way certainly matter, but the game is engineered to be close because whatever you don’t have the opportunity to get, your enemy will. You thus pay for that crescendo of excitement with the seeds of doubt about how much your efforts influenced the final outcome. In fairness, it is difficult to design really dramatic games that don’t involve a lot of random moments, and this one hides it fairly well.;One other secret weapon the game has in this regard is its other major new feature: fortresses. At any given time there are three fortress tiles available of the full seven, one for each space on the map. They all cost large amounts of skill symbols and gold, but come with benefits to match. Not only do these rewards tie in with the central game mechanics, such as free ring track spaces if you gain the tower of Minas Tirith in Gondor, but they allow you to place a fortress piece in the matching space, which acts as an undefeatable army there. Fortresses are thus huge pivots in winning over map spaces. At the same time, buying a tile is the only way you can delay taking a card and thus potentially force your opponent into taking one that flips those critical unrevealed cards instead.;For all the vibrant card art and name-checking of key places and people in Middle-earth, the game doesn't end up feeling like an evocation of Tolkien’s trilogy. Grabbing ring cards is no substitute for the long, desperate chase depicted in the books and there’s no real matchup between allying factions and the rewards they offer. Worse, the game often feels counter-thematic. There’s nothing to stop Sauron allying with his most implacable foes, the Elves, and the armies of the free peoples often end up conquering the shadow realm of Mordor and buying its fortress of Barad-Dur. These outcomes would have been unthinkable in the carefully constructed legendarium, but they’re so common here it makes light of Tolkein’s vast imaginative effort.\", 'Play builds towards a truly thrilling climax almost every time')\n",

Back in 2021 it got an animated TV treatment, expanding its fan base considerably and opening the door to other spin off products such as this cooperative board game. In the show, the protagonists are teenagers, struggling to learn how to use their powers to defend the world after a massacre of older, more experienced superheros. So here, you get to create them from the ground up in Invincible: The Hero-Building Game.;Although it’s very much a board game, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game doesn’t have much of a board. Instead of anything fold-out, there are three separate boards that sit next to one another, representing three different areas of wherever the scenario you’re playing takes place. Each has spaces for heroes, villains, minions and civilians. They’re very basic, presumably so that they work as whatever location you’re supposed to be in, but they’re perfectly functional.;Assuming you like the style of the original Invincible comic, the remainder of the components are much more engaging. There are standees for the four playable heroes, plus Omni-man, lots of civilian and minion tokens, and multiple decks of cards for things like events, villains and hero powers, all resplendent with licensed comic art from Invincible, although the typography on the cards is a little gauche.;Aside from various cardboard and wooden markers, the other components are related directly to the playable heroes and scenarios, with a tracking board for each of these, again festooned in relevant comic art. With all those panels assembled together on the tabletop, your play area begins to look like a comic book in and of itself.;Rather than a point-by-point rulebook, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game walks you through the introductory scenario step by step, and then has an addendum for more advanced rules. This is a divisive approach, but it works well here, allowing you to get into the basics of the game with a minimum of fuss. Everyone picks a hero from the available roster of Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode and Robot, seeds a bag with a variety of colored cubes, and dives in, working together to save the globe from an alien invasion.;There are three board areas, each one of which has spaces for heroes, villains and a mass of innocent bystanders, who fluctuate between safe and dangerous zones. On your turn you’ll start by drawing three cubes from your bag and assigning them to your hero powers, allowing you to do things like move, attack, or rescue civilians. Colored cubes have to be assigned to matching color powers: yellow is fighting, for instance, while blue tends to be more about rescue and recovery. Black cubes are wild and can be assigned anywhere, but there’s a catch: you can keep drawing and assigning cubes as long as you like, but if you get more than four black cubes, you’re exhausted and out of the round.;We’ve seen this kind of push-your-luck bag-drawing before in games like Quacks of Quedlinburg, and it’s really fun. By allowing players to control their own risk, it offers a neat balance of excitement and strategy. But it’s particularly good here because most hero powers require more than one cube to activate, meaning you’ve got to be incredibly careful about your priorities. If you really, really want to attack this round, it’s tempting to throw black cubes into your yellow powers, but then yellow cubes drawn are less useful. And on the flip side, if you haven’t quite filled and activated a power when you close in on that five-cube limit, those you’ve assigned will be wasted unless you risk another draw.;It’s superpowered swings and roundabouts and the right choice is situational, depending on whether you’re on the verge of taking out an enemy, or suffering a catastrophic number of civilian deaths. Running it close to the line when there’s a critical outcome on the line is hugely exciting and, as a bonus, it alleviates the common pitfall of cooperative play where the most experienced player directs the others. It’s your turn, it’s your bag, and it’s up to you how risky you want to play it, then down to fate whether you’ll live up to your character’s heroics or blow it for the whole team.;After all the players have finished drawing cubes and taking actions, it’s on to the training phase. You’ll each have a hand of five cards representing potential superpowers your teenage hero might learn to manifest. Orange cubes drawn during your turn can be assigned to confidence, which is essentially a currency you can use to buy these cards. This adds a whole new layer of strategy to proceedings as you look for combos between your starting powers, those in your hand and the cubes in your bag, a multi-way mash-up of bag-building and tableau building from an enormous deck of powers, for a colossal amount of variety and strategic flex.;As fun as this is, it does leave some thematic question marks hanging over the game. While the heroes do grapple with learning their powers in the comic, the idea that it’s a revolving door of different abilities they can try on for size and discard feels like a stretch too far. Similarly, while each hero starts with a signature purple power keyed to their abilities – Rex Splode can damage all enemies in the vicinity with an explosion, for example – there’s nothing to stop you choosing a roster of entirely unrelated powers to go along with it. You could make Rex, who is selfish and reckless in the source material, a caring, sharing support character with lots of healing and buff powers if you so wish.;Invincible: The Hero Building Game earns back some thematic brownie points in the villain phase. Here, you draw an event card that has different instructions for villains and their minions, which will see them damaging heroes, killing civilians and using special powers, at least until such time as you do enough damage to them to get them off the board. You may also get a boost from some outside help, or include optional challenges like having to zap back and meet shifts at work to make things even tougher.;Each scenario has a selection of randomly drawn and scenario-specific enemies that enter play as the game progresses, as well as some thematic special rules. The whole package gives each scenario plenty of thematic heft as well as variety for replay value. In the second scenario, for instance, you’ll face the annoying Doc Seismic, who won’t enter play until the final round, giving you limited time to defeat him. And in the meantime, you’ll have to watch out for him accumulating damage to Mount Rushmore, which will lose you the game if it takes too much. Other ways you can lose include an excessive civilian death toll, or too many hero knock-outs from enemy damage.;To try and avoid this fate, you’ve always got the option to fly back to HQ and rest up, recovering some health and your defiance token, a handy option that lets you re-draw cubes if you don’t like what you pulled. However, doing so takes you away from the frontline, so this is very much robbing Peter to pay Paul, as while you’re away, your team-mates and civilians will be left to face the punishment. But this is typical of the game, which does a great job of keeping the tension high and making you feel like you’re stretched too thin, walking a strategic knife-edge between victory and defeat. And this matches the tone of the comic, too.', None)\n",

However, in the wide, deep sea of take-that games in which Courtisans belongs, it’s a shark in it’s own right: sleek, powerful and often taking you by surprise. There might not be a whole lot to this box, either in terms of content quantity or rules, but it does what it’s supposed to do pretty much perfectly.', 'Courtisans is a nasty game with significant random and social factors – so your enjoyment will depend on how mean-spirited you like to get in a game of cards.', \"Gaming has a very long tradition of very small card games that allow players to be very mean to one another. Arguably it goes back to the days of playing cards and the Hearts family of evasive trick-taking where you’re trying to avoid winning points, some versions of which see you passing pain cards to other players, and getting their cruft in turn.;So it’s a crowded market to venture into, but with it’s super-simple rule set and beautiful cards, Courtisans clearly feels it has the chops to make a splash nevertheless.;As a small-box card game, there’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality. The main draw is the main deck of tarot-sized cards in five colors, representing five noble families, each one luminous with characterful artwork and gold embossing. They’re an absolute delight, justaposing a character and its suite symbol – which doubles as a color marker for the colorblind – in the manor of a court card from a deck of playing cards.;The rest of the compact box is less attractive. There’s a much smaller, much plainer deck of objective cards and a rolled-up board made of printed fabric depicting the families feasting at the queen’s table. The art is in the same grand style as the cards, and rolled up boards are easy to store but fabric, while eco-friendly, isn’t the most practical choice. Because it’s stored in a roll, it won’t lie flat on the table without a sheet of perspex or an iron. This isn’t a major issue during play as cards go above or below the board, not on it, but it is a shame that it doesn’t show off more of that glorious art to full effect.;Gamers have a bit of a reputation for claiming that games are simple when they’re anything but, and this is particularly true of card games when half the rules can be printed on the cards themselves. But Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn. On your turn, you draw three cards from the deck. One, you keep face up in front of you. Another you place, face up, before an opponent of your choice. And the third you place either above or below the Queen’s table, in the column matching its suit.;Once the deck runs out, suits that have more cards above the table than below are “esteemed” and each one in a player’s tableau is worth a point. Those with more cards below than above are “fallen” and each costs you a point. Cards with a x2 icon are worth double in both reckonings. Tot up your points, and see who’s won. The only other complexities to this formula are a smattering of special cards: spies do not reveal their suit until the game ends, assassins remove a card from whatever area they’re laid in, and guards can’t be assassinated.;You’ve now learned almost the entire rules of Courtisans. And you would not believe just how much angst is lurking below that smooth, approachable ruleset and those lovely cards.;The fact that you lay almost all the cards face up, the odd spy excluded, means there’s nowhere to hide. When a pile of red cards are cowering pitifully below the queen’s table, and you give another player a red card, that’s an outright act of aggression. You’re saying, “I want you to lose”, and no amount of apologetic talk or sour-puss facial expressions can disguise it. It’s like the famous, blood-draining, knife-twist betrayals of Diplomacy, allegedly Henry Kissinger's favorite board game, except you haven’t taken seven hours to get there, and you’ll commit a dozen more such hostilities in this game alone.;And the game contains a number of ways to make every gut-punch worse. You can give someone an out-of-favor suit and make it worse by adding the same suit to the stack below the table. You can double the misery in both respects by doing the same with one or two x2 cards. You can give someone an assassin in an out-of-favor suit and kill one of their higher scoring, in favor, cards. And then you can rub salt in the wounds by laying the one decent option in your three-card draw in your own tableau.;This outright, in-your-face meanness does mean that the game works best with four. With two, you’ve only got one target. With three, and to a lesser extent with five, it’s very easy to dogpile one poor player into oblivion relatively early in the game, although given it only takes a quarter-hour to play that’s hardly the end of the world, and no doubt your bullying will be remembered in turn for the next hand. But four strikes the perfect balance of blow and counterblow.;In all cases, you’ll have to do your level best to direct the pain away from yourself and toward other players, in the time-honored fashion of trying to persuade people to target the current leader. Some people love this kind of trash talk, others hate it, and this probably isn’t a game for them. But to prevent anyone from becoming an easy target, there’s one final cog to the game’s mechanisms: everyone gets two secret missions. These are all straightforward, like ensuring a particular suit is fallen or esteemed or owning two assassins. But they do the job very effectively, muddying the waters and adding to the excitement while giving you a reason to keep a poker face when someone slaps a card down.;At this point, it feels important to mention that luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve. While the initial few plays are uncertain, mapping out the status of the different suits and the interpersonal dynamics between the players for the game to come, the collection of cards rapidly reaches a level where decision-making is decidedly non-obvious. A simple card might raise or lower someone’s score, but then there are the hidden goals to be aware of. And the special cards inject additional dynamism: assassins in particular make it very difficult to properly weigh the correct course of action. The card itself may be worth a point, or not, but its choice of target can also impact the game in subtle ways.;This uncertainty dovetails beautifully with the social aspects of the game, into an ouroboros that’s likely to end up eating someone at the table along with its tail. You start to feel like every play contains both a social and a strategic message. What does it mean that the player opposite gave a green to their neighbor? Does it say something about their own secret goals, or the spies they placed the turn before? Or is it more of a gotcha revenge moment, for that neighbor dumping rubbish on them early in the game, or even for a disagreement they had last week? Is it worth making an argument out loud for the table? And if so what form should it take, and what will persuade your fellow players that might give you an edge? It’s amazing how such a tiny game can tease at all the communal faultlines around the table.\", 'Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn;There’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality;Luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve')\n",

But it takes half the time to play and is less complex while hitting many of the same mechanical highs, so it’s very much a trade-off. Gamers who want more deterministic strategy may also be put off by the number of dice involved, but that action dice system gives the game a rare combination of dynamism and strategic heft as you’re forced to roll with the punches. If you have the time, and the considerable asking price, this is a great head-to-head conflict game that gives players a taste of much heavier wargames in a reasonably approachable package.', 'Dune: War for Arrakis is a great head-to-head conflict game that gives players a taste of much heavier wargames in a reasonably approachable package.', 'If there’s a sci-fi equivalent to the fantasy cultural juggernaut that is Lord of the Rings, then it’s Frank Herbert’s Dune. So it’s perhaps surprising that the same design team of Marco Maggi and Francesco Nepitello are responsible for big strategy war board games on both subjects. Their Tolkien game, 2004’s War of the Ring, is a widely recognised classic board game, marrying asymmetric maneuver warfare with the rich narrative possibilities of the novel.;Now they’re hoping to repeat the same acclaim using some of the same mechanics in Dune: War for Arrakis, as the houses Harkonnen and Atreides fight for control of the desert planet.;As a CMON game, one of the big draws in this big box is the big selection of miniatures, and Dune: War for Arrakis doesn’t disappoint. There are three trays of figures, which range from generic and elite soldiers for two-player sides in multiple sculpts, to detailed miniatures of all the main characters from Dune, including Paul Atreides and Baron Harkonnen. There are also some big, chunky miniatures of vehicles like harvesters and carryalls, and bigger, chunkier miniatures of the famous sandworms that infest the desert planet.;While the figures are the main draw here, production values are high across the contents of the box. The board, depicting the inhabited areas of the titular planet and the deeper desert regions around it, comes in two full-sized halves to match the epic scale of the action, lavished with artwork that makes the most of the beige hues that are enforced by the desert geography. There’s a sheet of good quality cardboard tokens to punch, a big bag of custom dice and several decks of glossy cards.;For such a visual feast it is, perhaps, surprising that beyond the board the art is pretty sparse. Most of the cards are bare, while the character cards have ink sketches of their subjects rather than full color. There are also some player boards to help each player track their game state, and these are surprisingly flimsy, especially given the full-on production treatment on show elsewhere. However, even these minor let-downs are perfectly functional and clear, attractive graphic design makes up for the lack of card art.;Like the designer’s other best-known titles, this uses an action dice game system. Both sides get a handful of these dice to roll, four for the Atreides and eight for the Harkonnen, and the faces that come up indicate what actions you can take. Most are fairly self-explanatory: strategy and leadership both let you move and attack with your forces, under slightly different circumstances, while deployment lets you add troops to the board, and Mentat actions let you draw cards. If you have named leaders—characters from the franchise—in play then their cards tend to power up these basic actions, giving you more options.;It’s a great system, so much so that it’s surprising it’s not been copied more by other designers. The actions you roll are critical, so that initial spill of dice across the board is heart-stopping. But whether you get what you wanted or not, there’s a lot of creative strategy involved in trying to make the best of what fortune has given you. You way want to deploy before you attack, for example, or if you’re short on military options, perhaps fishing for cards might give you what you need. Every choice has a knock-on effect, every strategy needs to be flexible to cope with the whims of fate, and every time one player spends a die, their opponent will need to reconsider their choices on the fly. It’s brilliant.;Whatever you choose, your picks then feed into the second layer of this interesting meat-grinder. Like most of the best board games, Dune: War for Arrakis gives both players competing priorities and not enough troops or actions to cover them all. The Harkonnen have a very clear military and action advantage but, to maintain it, they must harvest and deliver spice else the Emperor will withdraw support in the form of locking up some action dice. Those deliveries are very vulnerable to raids by the Atreides troops, which, while fewer, can survive in the deep desert. But to win, rather than just survive, the Harkonnen player must find and destroy enemy settlements hidden in the desert, while their opponent needs to fulfil missions that vary each turn and find the ecological testing stations that dot the board.;So, for both sides, when you attack, you inevitably leave yourself short on defence. Choosing the balance is central to the strategy and tactics of the board game, and boils down to how well you use your cards, troops and action dice, and read the situation on the board. Initially, the Harkonnen player seems incredibly dominant starting with more troops, ornithopters to move them, and having unlimited reinforcements compared to a paltry eight deployment actions over the entire game for their opponents.;Combat is dice based and this random, but a lack of combat effects in the card decks means weight of numbers usually tells. While this can feel repetitive, it aids in planning strategy, and the Harkonnen will likely steamroll over the first few settlements very fast. But their flow of spice, and with it their access to dice, will stutter, and their troops will suffer if left exposed in the desert. Then the Atreides can start to make use of their much more flexible arsenal, including command of the giant sandworms, and turn the tide.;Not that that prolongs the action past its welcome. Games like this, with fairly complex rules, narrative aspirations, and bags of miniatures, have a reputation for playing long, but Dune: War for Arrakis is a very welcome change in that regard. At around two hours for a game, it’s long enough to feel epic, but not too long to tax your patience or your free time. There might even be time to swap sides and re-rack for a rematch. It’s secret here is simply the rapid manner in which players accrue victory points.;Each settlement has a secret value between one and three, and the Harkonnens need just ten to win. Meanwhile, the Atreides have a secret win condition based on three different victory pools and their missions, too, will be scoring on every turn. The hidden aspects of both ensure there’s a tense finish to every game.;Despite the detailed miniatures and thematic trappings, narrative is one area where the game falls down. Yes, the spice and the worms and other iconic trappings of the franchise are all here, but this is very much a wargames, and there’s little sign of the politics and treachery that characterize the novel series, let alone its explorations of ecology, gender dynamics and other issues. It’s also notable that very little coherent story emerges from the play, besides the obvious one about the cut and thrust of powerful attacks and heroic defences. This might all sound a tall order for a game, and it is, but this design team managed to tick all those boxes against the source material of their previous effort, War of the Ring.;For more, check out our picks for the best alternatives to Warhammer, the best board games for couples, and the best deck-building board games.', 'At around two hours for a game, it’s long enough to feel epic, but not too long to tax your patience or your free time')\n",

However, it does come with one major caveat: despite all the improvements on offer, the game flow still feels a lot like Wingspan, a game very many people have already played a considerable number of times. If you’re one of those people, you may not feel there’s enough novelty here to overcome that nagging sense of familiarity even though, deep down, there really is. If you’re not in that camp, this is very much worth your time. And if you are, it’s still worth digging into, as you might find some surprising draconic treasure beneath that familiar facade.', 'Wyrmspan takes the basic shape of Wingspan with its addictive engine-building, smooths out the wrinkles, and adds new layers of strategy with relatively few extra rules.', \"You might have heard about a game called Wingspan, which went from being acclaimed in the hobby space to selling a massive million-plus copies in retail. It did so not only by being a fun board game but thanks to its accessible and appealing theme where players manage a bird sanctuary. It was not without its critics, particularly over its slightly repetitive structure, and those concerns have fed into the design of a more complex re-skin, Wyrmspan, where players represent mighty dragon wranglers in a fantasy setting.;The original game was famous for its high production values--that’s another key plank of its wide appeal--and while Wyrmspan isn’t quite as pretty, it doesn’t disappoint in that department either. It has a collection of multicolored, speckled resin eggs just like its predecessor, a slew of punch out cardboard resource tokens and two neat plastic storage boxes to keep them in. The coins are cardboard but are silvered, which is a lovely touch.;Players each get a selection of wooden cubes and an adventurer piece in their color, along with one of five boards to track their growing menagerie of dragons, which is where most of the game state will get tracked. There are three other shared boards, one to track the round and its associated bonuses, another is a dragon guild board with four different bonus tiles to sit in the middle, and the final one organizes the dragon and cave decks.;The dragon deck is enormous--almost 200 cards--each with its own distinctive art. While the dragons are impressive, it’s not on a par with the luminous illustrations of real-world birds in Wingspan. And the graphic design generally verges on the bland, with most of the boards being empty space printed with generic fantasy-style fonts. Not that that matters so much once they’re covered in face-up dragons.;If you’re familiar with Wingspan you’ll already have a good grasp on how to play Wyrmspan--there’s a boxout in the rules that should make learning it a cinch and is part of what makes it a popular family board game --but there are some key differences. Players start each of four rounds with six coins, and each of the game’s three actions--excavate, entice and explore--costs a coin to perform. Sometimes an action will cost an additional coin or give you a coin back, so the number of actions you can take each turn varies.;Excavate lets you play cave cards from your hand into one of three different dragon habitats on your player board. You’ll need to have a cave card to get dragons into anything other than the initial slot, and playing a card also nets you a bonus printed on the card, such as additional resources or card draws. Entice allows you to play a dragon from your hand into an empty cave. This will cost you resources like meat and gold, printed on the dragon’s card, in addition to the coin. Dragons are a major source of victory points, and most have other printed effects.;Some dragons have an ability when played, others at the end of a round, but for most you’ll need the third action type, Explore, to get the most out of them. This is the most complex action, in which you send your little adventurer meeple into any inhabited caves, gaining benefits depending on which habitat you’re exploring and what dragons you’ve got played there. The Crimson Cavern will let you get food resources to spend on dragons, while the Golden Grotto and Amethyst Abyss will net you cave and dragon cards, respectively, from a face-up selection. The more dragons in a given habitat, the deeper you can go and the better the rewards will be.;You’re thus immediately caught in a classic board game dilemma: you need food and cave cards to play dragons, but without dragons, it’s hard to get food and cave cards. There’s nothing for it but to bite the bullet and take some pathetically weak explore actions while you try and build a strategy, but the big question is what aspects are you going to favor, and which can you neglect?;Decisions here will be heavily impacted by what dragon and cave cards you start with. For example, some cave cards give you food tokens, so you might feel you can wait on populating your Crimson Cavern. And this is where the additional complexity of Wyrmspan begins to bear fruit over its predecessor. The extra concepts ensure there’s a lot more interplay in effects between the cards in your hand and the actions you can take, ensuring there’s more tactics and strategy game in your choices.;Perhaps the most notable of these new features is the dragon guild board. You can earn moves on this board in various ways, and each earns you a small bonus from the space you land on. However, for each half-cycle you get to pick a larger bonus from the tile in the middle, many of which include big end-game scoring bonuses. The rewards you get here are substantial enough to build a strategy around, and with four different middle tiles together with that colossal stack of dragon cards there’s a ton of variety to explore during repeat plays.;Other particularly noteworthy changes include the removal of the random food roll of Wingspan in favor of a free choice of food resources and the swapping out of action cubes for the coins resource. While the latter might sound like a small change it has a big impact, because now cards can earn or cost you coins, changing the amount of actions you can take in a turn, which you have to factor into your planning. It even introduces a bigger element of timing into the game, as if you have more or less actions than other players it will change the urgency with which you feel you might have to take things from the shared boards, like the selection of face-up dragons and caves.;Hatchlings, a specific subtype of dragon card, add to this sense of time-based pressure. They can be awkward to put into play because they require milk, a resource that’s otherwise largely useless. But once on your player mat, each visit from an adventurer yields a bonus until the third, which offers an extra-impressive benefit. This imparts a real sense of urgency to try and get these whelps played, to make sure you’ve got time for enough visits to trigger the bonus and enjoy its effects.;However, timing your plays effectively to get what you need before others do is about the only level of player interaction you’ll find in the game. For most of it, you’ll be preoccupied with building your own dragon-powered game engine, not caring what your opponents are doing. Thankfully, this is a fully absorbing task on its own, thanks to all the different ways in which card effects overlap, and the sheer amount of in-game variety takes up some of the slack left by the lack of in-game interaction.;Check out our roundups of the best board games of the '90s, as well as the best cheap board games.\", 'The dragon deck is enormous - almost 200 cards - each with its own distinctive art;This is where the additional complexity of Wyrmspan begins to bear fruit over its predecessor')\n",

At the same time, the puzzle of polyomino placement and different sources of points give it a harder strategic edge than its accessible rules might suggest. And to top it all off, win or lose, you get to marvel at the delightful 3D city you’ve built, replete with a glorious mix of little wooden wonders. It’s a game that manages to be a little wonder in and of itself.', '', 'The wonders of the ancient world have long held a strong grip on the gaming imagination, from the lightweight card drafting of 7 Wonders to the intense strategy board game spreadsheet that is Through the Ages. Trying to crack the more accessible end of the spectrum while still leaving a board game about ancient civilization building feeling like a game about ancient civilization building is a tough ask, however. Many games have tried and failed. The latest contender is World Wonders, and it has a surprising secret weappn: super cute wooden meeples representing a range of ancient edifices.;World Wonders might not look much from the outside, what with its gray box -- but in play, it’s a visual wonder in and of itself. Its key flair is the inclusion of those 21 tiny wooden figures that depict different ancient moments. These are, at once, both cute and astonishing, from the board-dominating heights of the giant, green Machu Picchu monument to the three modest but characterful Moai of Easter Island.;These monuments get put on each player’s board, alongside smaller 3D wooden towers and all sorts of flat cardboard tiles representing city districts and roads. There are a lot of these in the game, and they need to be sorted by type and size before you play. The art on player boards and tiles is bright and functional, but organizing all the components either at game start or end can be quite a pain.;Players also get another board with tracks representing their progress, one for each color, which matches a stylized wooden piece. These sit on a main board which holds some of the tile stacks and are used to track player orders. At game end, this flips over into a handy score track to tally up the points. There are also some reference cards, some additional boards to hold extra pieces for higher player counts, and tiny wooden markers for the resource tracks, which are neat but very easy to lose.;Finally, there are three decks of cards in the box. The first is used to determine which wonders are currently available to build. The others won’t see use in every game, as one controls an automaton for solo board game play, while the other has advanced game objectives for more experienced players. All three decks are drab and functional.;Every player gets their own gridded city mat -- featuring either a lake or a river, and dotted with natural resource squares -- and a set of tracks to record their population and other resources. They also get a free 4-square road tile to start off their city. Anything else they want to build, they have to pay for from the seven gold they get each round. There are generally 10 such rounds, although it can occasionally end earlier.;Most of your gold will be spent on building a road network through your city, and the building tiles that will go alongside those roads. There are several piles of buildings, with each stack having the same tile shape and cost but coming in different colors, representing different kinds of districts.  One of each shape is available each round, flipped randomly off the shuffled stack so you never know what district types will be available, and once it’s gone, it’s gone. A new one will be revealed at the start of the next round. Road tiles and towers, from which you can start new road networks, are similarly limited.;Buildings also add resources to your tracks, depending on the size and type of district that you purchased. There are three of these plus a fourth, population, with only advances at specific intervals marked on the other tracks. Their only in-game function is to score you points. Population is worthless until you get toward the end of the track, when it’ll net you a few bonuses. For the other three, you score only your lowest track, making it important not to let one lag behind.;Your final choice for spending money is on wonders. Unlike the other stock, there are always three of these available, and they don’t have a fixed price. You simply spend all your remaining gold to obtain it. They come in various shapes and sizes and have multiple placement rules, which are listed on the card. The Parthenon, for example, takes up six squares and those squares must be adjacent to a road, a natural resource and a library district tile. Most wonders are worth a victory point, but a few also push you up a resource track.;While that might seem a lot to take in, that is, pretty much, the entire game. This isn’t a difficult game to teach, so it’s good for family board game play, and everyone should have got the hang of it halfway through their first game. Its genius is that those simple rules interact to make the business of planning your city far trickier than it first appears.;For starters, there’s a huge pressure from competing priorities in World Wonders. Roads and the smaller, cheaper district tiles are incredibly hot properties and if you don’t nab one on your first action each round, you may find it’s gone for good. But while these things are both cheap and essential, neither may help you expand your city the way you want. In particular, they may not dovetail with the placement rules for the wonders currently on display, so any districts that do will similarly be hot property. With a paltry seven gold and a pack of players descending like hyenas on anything they can eke points out of, learning how to prioritize properly is a key skill.;It also lends the game a degree of intensity that something that sounds so sedate should not possibly generate. The clever costing of wonders, which spend you out and so end your turn, feed into this. Obviously, you want to spend as little as possible on whatever wonders you pick up. But if you leave it too long, or take too many actions putting the pieces into place to meet a wonder’s placement rules, someone else may have snapped it up. A new one is revealed right away, but whether you’ll have the right districts and space to place it already is anyone’s guess.;However, purchase order is not the only thing you have to consider. A big part of strategy in World Wonders is balancing the need for tiles you buy to advance you on the right tracks and to slot neatly into your city. You can’t afford to let one track lag behind, but you also want to race ahead to gain population points for a bonus. And tiles you box in on all sides with landscape features, roads or other tiles, can earn decisive bonus points. So there’s a critical aspect of spatial strategy which makes it far more engaging than the phrase “resource tracks” might suggest.;Despite all the nearly interlocking mechanics, a sense of repetition does begin to set in toward the end of the game. But it remains an engaging strategic challenge, nevertheless. It’s easy to lose sight of one or more of the strategic ideas you’re trying to juggle and fall behind. This is especially true when you’re using the end game goal cards, which throw even more points into the mix, and competing priorities along with them. Another strategy factor is the availability of loans, which net you an additional two gold to spend on a turn at the cost of repaying three later, or some victory points if you fail to do so.;For more, check out our picks for the best board games for parties, the best board games for kids, and the best 3-player board games.', 'World Wonders might not look much with its gray box, but in play, it’s a visual wonder in and of itself')\n",

It has enough interaction to interest those who like to engage directly with their fellow players, but its positive spin won’t put anyone’s nose out of joint. Gaming neophytes might find it a bit much to take on, despite its appealing theme, and it really needs repeat plays to get to grips with its rich systems. But while that can be difficult in this era of ever-churning new titles, it’s also the sign of a game with real staying power.', 'Apiary adds a lot of new elements to the strategy genre -- perhaps too many. But if you can get a handle on how all the systems work together, it could be a game with real staying power.', \"Everyone likes bees. Brightly colored, fuzzy, industrious: what's not to love? So if you wanted to make bees even more appealing or exciting, there's only one way to go: make them into space bees! That's the setup for Apiary, the new strategy game from first time designer Connie Vogelmann. In the far future, bees have evolved intelligence and taken their peaceable lifestyles to the stars. Players are rival factions, who must both cooperate and compete to demonstrate their philosophies are superior.;Like a lot of modern strategy board games, Apiary starts with a lot of cardboard-punching. There are all sorts of building and upgrade hexes to push out of their cardboard sprues, along with waggle dance tracks, planet tiles and various other chits and counters. A deck of seed cards is also included, and there’s a big fold-out board with various tracks and action spaces on it. It’s all serviceable enough stuff, although the art is a little drab.;Fans of wood and plastic won’t be disappointed when they go rummaging in the deeper recesses beneath. There are shaped wooden tokens to track supplies of various resources, with the wax and honey tokens being painted a neat metallic sheen and a chunky bee miniature that serves as the mothership which flies around exploring the galaxy. Each player color also has four plastic worker pieces, which are bee-shaped but with a cubic center that rotates to show values between one and four. These are ink-washed so you can see the numbers and details clearly.;Player piece sets are rounded out with some wooden cubes in their color to record progress on various tracks and a docking mat to organize their pieces. Players also get a hive mat which has spaces for their growing colony and a faction tile which gives them some starting hexes for their hive and a condition for extra victory points. There are five different hives and 20 factions, so there are lots of possible starting combinations.;There’s a lot of stuff in the box and, at first, it looks like it won’t all fit back in. However, there’s a clever plastic organizer included which keeps it all together. How it all packs down isn’t obvious and there’s no guide in the rules, but a quick search online should show you how it works.;At first glance, Apiary looks like a classic worker placement and resource management board game. Most of your turns will be spent placing worker bees from your docking mat into action spaces on the board and gaining the benefits. Explore lets you move the mothership around, revealing planets and gaining resources. Advance lets you spend those resources to gain farm, recruit and development tiles to add to your hive, each of which grants additional bonuses. Grow gives you the chance to add empty cells to your hive for future building, or new workers to place on future turns. Convert does what it says on the tin, allowing you to change up basic resources for more advanced ones.;As ever in board games of this style, the overall aim is to gain victory points, and there’s a bewildering array of ways to do so, in the interest of offering multiple ways to win. From this standpoint, it’s still a standout title that features a lot of nicely rounded and well-integrated mechanics. You need buildings on your hive mat to store resources, for example, but you also need the resources to gain the buildings. Not only is this circular dependency interesting to solve mechanically, but it prevents players from stockpiling. It also adds a fun spatial strategy aspect to what otherwise might be something of a spreadsheet game. The same goes for exploring the galaxy, a mini-game where you move the mothership on a grid in which empty spaces reveal a random planet which may, or may not, grant you the resources you want.;But the game has a novel trick up its sleeve to surprise you, and it’s a doozy. Not all workers in Apiary are created equal. Those numbers on the body of each worker indicate its level, and this has a critical impact on play. Most actions work better the higher the level worker is assigned to it. More resource conversions on the convert action, more squares to move on the explore action, and so on. Furthermore, explore and advance can hold two workers each, and when a second worker is assigned you get to use the sum of both levels, regardless of which player owns the other.;This sets up a fascinating dance of interaction. Going first lets you grab the action and results you’re looking for, but waiting may be beneficial, as you might get to tag along with a higher-level worker. Furthermore, workers don’t block each other from spaces in Apiary. If you want to use an occupied spot, you can go right ahead and do so, but the owner gets their bee back, gets to increase its level and can choose either to use it again on a later turn on “land” it. This means it can be used to gain income from farms along with other returning workers if you run out of workers to place, whereupon they all gain a level, too.;Positive interaction of this kind is very novel, and it leaves Apiary in the brilliant position of feeling like a highly interactive game without the zero-sum, “take that” bites that a certain kind of gamer hates. Rather, bumping players off spots is often doing them a favor, and you need to take that into account when deciding your moves. Some spaces will hold two workers, and you get the action at the strength of them both added together, so, again, you must be careful being first to the spot. You get the advantage of an early selection, but you’re handing a hand-up to the following player. It’s a lovely balance of competing priorities.;Worker leveling also feeds into the end game and becomes a major source of points. Level four workers, the highest grade, are very powerful. Not only do they lend the highest level to their action, but they grant an additional bonus. A convert action with such a worker, for instance, lets you “dance,” creating a custom conversion of your choice that other players can later pay you to use. They’re also the only workers that can use the Monument action, which lets you buy tiles offering big end-game points. But once used, these top-level workers have to go into hibernation, earning you a small extra bonus, and once a player has hibernated seven bees, the game ends.;This gives control of the game end to player choice in yet another layer of interlocking systems. Indeed, if anything, there’s almost too much going on at once in Apiary. While the core rules loop isn’t that difficult to learn, the sheer number of options can feel overwhelming to new players. And even for the more experienced, it can make it hard to understand how the mechanical levers you’re pulling are leading to you getting points, or lack thereof. The result is a feeling of disconnect that’s sometimes frustrating, especially if you’re looking to work out how you can improve your play.;Mechanical disconnect like this is often a sign of a game that’s divorced from its theme and, indeed, Apiary is semi-abstract. You can see echoes of the bee’s lifecycle in the way you need to construct cells to expand your hive and, of course, in the busy nature of the workers you place. But at the same time, the game uses its futuristic overtones to good effect. This is particularly clear in the different game factions, each of which has its own starting setup and ways to score bonus points, giving you a huge pot of varied strategies to try out.;For more board game coverage, check out our picks for the best 90s board games, the best Star Wars board games, and the best board games for parties.\", None)\n",

If you do get the bug there are, naturally, dozens of characters you can collect, but the five-per-side selection in this core box is a great starting point and easily enough to have fun with. At the same time, its clever thematic flourishes and adaptive scenarios mean it’s also got enough novelty and challenge to please more experienced fans. If you’re up for the dice-chucking and counter-controlling required, you won’t go far wrong with this great starter set.', 'Marvel Crisis Protocol is a great introduction to the wild world of miniatures gaming.', \"Games with miniatures and games with the Marvel licence are ten a penny, but back in 2019 the bright sparks at Atomic Mass Games had the idea to put them together. The result was Marvel Crisis Protocol, a skirmish game where teams of super-powered characters duke it out over tactical objectives. It proved a smash hit, and now it’s back in an updated edition, Earth’s Mightiest Core Set (see it at Amazon), with cool new characters and more dynamic figures. Owners of the original Marvel board game can still use their figures, however, as they’re different versions of the same characters, with slightly different stats and powers.;Like a lot of miniature game starter boxes (for more, see our roundup of the best tabletop alternatives to Warhammer), the contents of Marvel: Crisis Protocol - Earth’s Mightiest Core Set isn’t much to look at when you draw the lid off for the first time. It’s mostly a lot of gray plastic sprues. There are no assembly instruction in the game -- instead they have to be downloaded from the website of the publisher, Atomic Mass Games. You’ll also need a craft knife, some polystyrene cement and a lot of time and patience to assemble the contents, although the figure poses are clean and obvious. No guessing games are required over whether you’ve got an arm or a leg at the correct angle.;Once you’ve put the time in, the results are spectacular. The 10 figures in this updated box are much more detailed and dynamic than their original counterparts. Doc Ock drips liquid from tentacle to test-tube, while Black Widow is captured in the act of tearing an Ultrabot in two.;In addition to the characters, there’s also a ton of scenery included, mimicking everyday street objects like lamps and cars. Some of the more spectacular pieces are wrecks and damaged buildings, enlivened by bits of crushed Ultrabots crawling out of the debris. Between them, there’s more than enough to start playing.;A pack of custom dice, character and crisis cards, a rules booklet and some sheets of cardboard sprues containing counters round out the box contents. As you can probably imagine given the wealth of comic art at the game’s disposal, everything looks bright and colorful with plenty of pictures to enliven the tiresome task of rules referencing.;For the most part, Marvel Crisis Protocol plays like a standard modern miniatures game. Characters get two actions which they can use to do things like move, attack or activate particular hero powers. Movement and range are measure with included custom tools to keep things fast and simple. Attacks are resolved by each player rolling a pool of dice and looking for hit or block symbols to attack or defend, with “wild” icons adding additional effects depending on the attack used.;With each character representing a superhero, you can probably imagine that these additional effects, along with their unique attacks and powers, encompass a wild range of wacky results. Spider-Man, for example, can slam enemy characters into the scenery, while Red Skull can warp both himself and other characters around the map. Most of the more powerful abilities require you to pay a resource called power which is in short supply at the beginning of the game.;However, in a twist of considerable genius, characters get extra power when they’re wounded and when they use particular attacks. This is a useful feedback loop that boosts a player taking hits due to unlucky dice, but it also results in an escalating feedback loop whereby the more everyone is punching and throwing each other around, the more options they have to punch and throw each other even harder. Characters also get dazed after accumulating enough wounds, which flips their character cards over and sometimes reveals even more powerful effects to bring into play.;The result is an ever-escalating fist-fight that feels like flipping the panels on your favorite comic. It won’t be long before characters are chaining attacks into other attacks, throwing the scenery around, throwing each other around -- sometimes into the paths of incoming attacks -- and criss-crossing the battlefield with energy beams or freeze rays and generally doing what superheroes do best: escalating craziness with every punch until someone finally gets hit for six at the climax.;Not only is this the thematic core of Marvel Crisis Protocol, it’s also where a lot of the tactical decisions lie. It all comes down to assessing the situation and trying to choose which heroes and powers will work best together to counter the enemy. While this is always an interesting challenge, the sheer number of different options at your disposal can also be overwhelming, even for experienced players. Most characters have two to three attack options and a further three or four passive powers. When you’re fielding a team of five or so operatives, it quickly gets hard to handle. As does the sheer number of tokens and tracking many powers require.;The remainder of the strategy comes from the game’s objective system. This is a clever concept that removes a lot of the rock-paper-scissors faction match-up issues that plague a lot of other miniatures games. You build a team of 10 models, and support that team with a choice of crisis cards, which determine the scenario, and team tactics cards, one-shot special powers. Each player draws a crisis card at random from their roster, and those two become the scenario objectives -- one detailing objectives to hold and one with items or civilians to get off the battlefield. They also mandate a points cap, and players can choose which of their 10 models to use up to that points value.;This is essentially a kind of sideboard system which allows you to strategically prepare sets of cards and figures that work well together and then finalize them when the exact parameters of the mission become clear. In turn, it offers tons of variety and means you can be much more flexible in how you approach your goals each and every game. So you’re reacting to a new tactical challenge each time by making informed decisions rather than just showing up with a list and hoping your picks will be up to doing whatever job turns out to be asked of them, as a lot of these kinds of games do.;While Marvel Crisis Protocol does give you plenty of tactical tools to work with, it’s also a dice-rolling heavy game. The custom dice icons take some getting used to, but they’re fun to use, especially when a power gives you lots of re-rolls or exclamation results give you extra dice for explosively powerful attacks. At the same time, that does make the game very swingy and prone to fate. This seems well-suited to the theme of the game, with fights often taking wildly unexpected turns just as one side thinks they have it in the bag, but those looking for a more in-depth strategy board game probably won’t be considering a game about comic-book characters having fist-fights in the first place.;Want more like this?

The player had to create an ever growing landscape of forests and fields, railways and rivers, trying to complete tasks in order to earn more tiles and keep playing. At the time, there was a lot of talk about how much like a board game it felt. Now, we’ve got a dedicated tabletop version which went on to win the 2023 Spiel des Jahres, the most prestigious prize in board gaming.;The Dorfromantik: The Board Game box is like a Russian doll, because most of what’s inside the box is more boxes. But you’re not supposed to open them right away: a key part of this game’s appeal is that it’s a campaign. Each game lets you tick off boxes on a campaign sheet based on your overall score and, as you progress through various branch points, you get to open different boxes and find out what’s inside.;When you start out, you only get to use what’s available inside the main box itself, which is lots and lots of hexagonal tiles. They’re all decorated in much the same way in a chunky, simplistic yet appealing art style that delineates various landscape features, just like the tiles in the video game.;There are also a bunch of counters, one for each landscape type, with numbers on the back. You also get a pad of scoresheets and campaign sheets. That’s your lot, and the relative dearth of content is more than enough to make you super-curious about what’s in those six additional sealed boxes nestled in the component tray.;Dorfromantik is easy to learn and play and, since it’s also a cooperative board game with all the players working together to build the landscape, it’s a great candidate for family board game night. On your turn you draw a tile, which will feature a mix of terrain elements, and fit it into your growing landscape. Most terrain elements can abut anything else you want them to. The exception are rivers and railways, each of which must be contiguous and can’t be cut off mid-flow with a different kind of tile.;There are two kinds of tiles: landscape tiles, which feature a mix of terrain elements, and task tiles, which are the same but also include a blank box. You fill this by drawing a counter of the matching terrain type and flipping it to reveal the number. That task is finished when that terrain type expands to the number on the counter, then you score that many points and draw another task. There must always be three tasks in play, so the first three turns always consist of adding task tiles. Otherwise, unless an existing task is finished, you must draw an ordinary landscape tile.;The only other feature of note to begin with are flags, which feature on three landscape tiles. These fit into the board like any other tile, but if you manage to close off the terrain type with the flag on it, so that none of that terrain is on the edge of the board, you’ll get points for each contiguous tile of that feature. When you run out of tiles, you add together the closed-off flags, your completed tasks and a point per hex of the longest river and railroad on your board, and that’s the final score.;At first, you’ll probably find this recreates that famous Zen-like calm of the original video game very well. It’s pleasant and undemanding, yet it’s just enough to occupy your brain and hands with the simple rules of the game to try and tot up some extra points here and there. The expanding landscape is attractive on the table. You can have a laugh and a joke as you play. It’s good fun. Your first game will almost certainly cross of a feeble single box on the campaign sheet, and you’ll wonder what you can do to score better and get down the track faster to find out what’s inside.;You won’t know it, but at this point you’re a Dorfromantik: The Board Game addict and there’s nothing you can do about it.;The genius of this game is that there’s a lot of shallow but subtle strategic decision-making beneath that placid exterior. There are indeed lots of ways to improve your score, some down to luck and some down to skill, several of which you probably realized mid-way through your first game. You’ll spot a couple more each time you progress those initial games, as none are particularly hard to grasp. But when you’ve got them down, you’ll realize that knowing what to do and putting it into practice are two very different things.;What makes it tricksy is the sheer openness of the landscape. Besides rivers and railways, you can stick any tile anywhere. Most tiles feature multiple terrain types and so can help advance more than one task. Despite the straightforward scoring conditions, the sheer array of options makes it far harder than you initially realize to work out what the best thing is to do with each tile as it comes up. It’s not difficult, as such, so the game still feels pleasantly undemanding, but you’ll often realize later there were better choices, and the way your skill grows with each attempt is even more enjoyable, making it a great board game for kids.;If you’re familiar with the video game, you’ll recognize quite how much of these mechanics mimic the gameplay elements of the original. But there’s one crucial difference. In the computer version, scoring tasks earns you extra tiles to prolong your game and increase your score. It isn’t long before the landscape you build gets out of control and your placement options alongside it. Trying to keep on top of this is a key skill. Here, though, you’re always using the same fixed pool of tiles to try and work towards bigger and bigger scores. This is, in many ways, far more manageable and satisfying.;I won’t say too much about what’s in boxes for fear of spoilers. Suffice to say that each adds another, simple rule to the game and increases your opportunities to score points. So, as you progress, additional strategy game wrinkles are revealed and your high scores slowly go up and up, meaning you can meander across the paths of the campaign sheet a bit faster each time. It’s hugely gratifying to do so and feel like your mastery is increasing over time, in addition to the reward of opening new campaign elements when you reach them.

The trouble is that in trying to re-create the fast, free-flowing action of the Clone Wars cartoons with so much detail, it slows the play down so that you get the narrative but not that feeling of pace and freedom. Having both would be an impossible trade-off, however, and Shatterpoint has made the right call in prioritising strategic interest and story over speed and succeeded wildly in making them come to life on your tabletop.', 'Star Wars: Shatterpoint carves out a distinct, tactical niche in the growing world of Star Wars games, but sometimes the amount of detail slows the play down.', 'Not long ago, there was such a lack of good Star Wars titles on tabletop that our best Star Wars board games list looked a little threadbare. Now, we’ve got Star Wars Shatterpoint, a new miniatures game which means there are now two significant lines of Star Wars-themed war board games, this and Star Wars Legion. This has raised a lot of questions about how the two differ from each other and whether one will \"fire\" the other, so let’s delve into Shatterpoint and see if we can answer those concerns.;What\\'s in the box? Plastic. Lots and lots of plastic. You could be forgiven for presuming that what you’d bought was some kind of Airfix model kit and not a game at all were it not for the rulebook that tops the package. That’s to be expected as most modern miniatures games are built from plastic sprues that you need to assemble yourself with a craft knife and polystyrene cement. But it still feels a little underwhelming to lift the lid and not find all your favorite Star Wars characters staring back at you.;Fortunately, the majority of the figures here are really easy and quick to build, although there are no instructions for doing so in the box -- you have to download them online. They come with angular joints that only fit together in specific poses, making assembly a breeze, although you’ll have to be careful with the very flimsy lightsabers on some of the models. The droids are an exception as their ball joints make them difficult to put together in the correct pose. They’re also 40mm scale which makes them easier to handle: for reference, the popular Games Workshop figures are 28 or 32mm scale.;You get the parts for sixteen different figures, all of which are from the Clone Wars cartoon series. Most recognizable among them are the four main characters: Anakin and Ahsoka Tano in the blue corner, and Lord Maul and Asajj Ventress in the red. They’re good sculpts but not outstanding ones, although the jetpack-borne Mandalorians are a nice touch. There’s also a lot of chunky scenery to assemble too, including lofted gantries to make sure the action stretches across all three dimensions.;Right at the bottom of the box, buried under a layer of cardboard, are the other actual game components: a bagful of custom dice and some small decks of cards. Most of these are plain but the artwork on the character cards is bright, brash and very reminiscent of the Clone Wars show while also having its own recognisable style. Keen figure painters may enjoy the fact that the box includes two printed cardboard backgrounds to photograph your painted miniatures in front of.;Shatterpoint comes with a meaty and foreboding rulebook which makes learning the 2-player game pretty daunting. But if you can find a rules explanation video online you’ll discover that the core game flow isn’t that hard to get down: the complexity comes from covering all the conditions, like disarmed or strained, and edge cases that open-movement miniatures games like this can throw up. It’s a skirmish game, so the idea is that you can enjoy cinematic action with a small squad of troops, unlike Star Wars Legion which covers much bigger battles at less granular detail.;Proceedings start with you selecting your figures for the game: you select two characters, each of which gives you a points allowance to spend on a secondary character and a support unit. The sixteen figures in the box give you exactly what you need for two sides to play a game. You then select a mission which determines where objective tokens will be placed on the tabletop and three random struggles are drawn that show which objectives will be active at different phases of the game. Securing objectives wins you points while knocking out enemy characters and some other actions reduce the number of points you need in order to win the struggle. Objectives change once a struggle is won, throwing the battlefield wide open again, and winning two struggles nets you the game.;Your characters each have a card that goes into an order deck along with a Shatterpoint card, which is wild. At the start of your turn, you draw a card and activate that unit or you can pay a “force point” to put the card into reserve, allowing you to activate it later, and draw another. Force points are also used during the turn to let characters use some of their more powerful abilities and they’re in short supply. They refresh when your order deck runs out and is reshuffled, but marshalling them for best effect is a tricky and engaging tactical challenge.;Activated figures can take two actions which include moving and fighting as you might expect. Movement is handled using included tools, saving the minor hassle of a tape measure, and involves jumping and climbing in the dynamic struggle for position as well as ground moves. There are some other actions to choose from. Figures can also take cover, allowing a small movement and a defensive bonus, or focus, which adds dice to their next attack. Much like the limited pool of force points, a mere two actions never seem enough and the game forces you into making trade-offs and taking risks in order to try and win objectives.;Combat in Shatterpoint uses a number of interesting mechanics but does feel a bit clunky and overblown. Each figure has values for melee and ranged attacks -- which can be zero -- and they roll that many attack dice looking for hits and criticals. The target will have a similar defense value and they roll different dice in an attempt to block hits, while criticals can’t be blocked. Both kinds of dice can also generate “expertise” which creates additional effects depending on how many of these faces are rolled and cross-referenced with a chart on the character card. While this can feel long-winded, it does allow the characters in the game to feel and play very differently from one another, giving you a varied palette of strategic options to exploit.;It’s the same story with the hits themselves: Shatterpoint doesn’t do anything as straightforward as translating unblocked hits directly into damage. Instead, there’s a chart for each character with multiple branch points and different combat effects along the way, and each hit lets you make one “move” on this chart. Again, this slows things down but the tradeoff is that you have to think about what path you want to take and which effects, usually including damage, you want to apply to the target. Some characters have more than one chart and they can flip between them for even more choices and even slower play, at least until you’ve internalized all the possibilities.;As if the expertise and combat chart systems aren’t enough to make each character feel unique, they also have their own palette of special abilities. Jedi like Anakin can deflect blaster bolts, droid units boost other droid units in close proximity and Maul gets immediate revenge attacks and buffs from wounds. Combined with the highly dynamic nature of movement, this palette of effects gives Shatterpoint an impressive level of narrative detail. Force users push and pull objects and characters around the battlefield, Manalorians fly about on jump packs and droids radio to each other.

And now Votes for Women is at the forefront of a new wave demonstrating that they can be very approachable and still be a brilliant way of exploring history. There are times when it feels frustratingly random, but that’s balanced by its relative simplicity and the sheer sense of excitement it generates both through dice and cards alongside its engrossing and still-relevant theme. Here’s hoping it heralds the genre for discovery by a new generation of gamers.', 'Votes for Women is at the forefront of a new wave of card games demonstrating that they can be very approachable and still be a brilliant way of exploring history.', 'Back in 1993, an unassuming game about the American Revolution called We the People launched a revolution in historical board games. By adding a deck of cards that mimicked historical events and putting political control on par with military occupation it merged politics and warfare into one neat package. Its more recent predecessors have eschewed the war board game aspect to focus on the politics, and the latest in this line is Votes for Women, in which you’ll refight the struggle for women’s suffrage in America with cards and dice.;Votes for Women packs a lot into its slim bookcase box. There’s a sturdy board featuring a map of America with the states picked out using two-letter codes, which may confuse non-US players. There are also several thick decks of cards, one for the suffrage player, one for the opposition and one for solo board game play, along with some smaller decks. All are illustrated with photos and political cartoons from the era which do a great job of setting the tone and give it a classic board game feel.;There’s also half a tree’s worth of wood in the form of dozens of little wooden cubes in purple, yellow and red along with some male and female campaigner figurines in matching colors. Unusually, Votes for Women gives you plenty of spares in this regard, including offering a choice of figure poses so you can use which ones you like best. There are also wooden checkmarks and crosses to indicate states which have passed or rejected the suffrage amendment, a lovely touch which looks awesome on the board. A few wooden cylinders, variously-shaped dice and cardboard chits round out the play components.;As is common for historically-oriented games there’s a booklet of designer’s notes alongside the rules, explaining how the designer, Tory Brown, feels the mechanics of her game tie into the history. What’s far less common but potentially far more interesting is a sheaf of facsimile historical documents, from a replica of a New York Times front page to a sample ballot from Chicago. If you’re interested in the history of this era, they’re a delight.;As card-driven games go, Votes for Women is pretty straightforward. You get a hand of event cards and can bid “buttons” - an abstract resource approximating campaign funding and momentum - to get a bonus strategy card from a face-up selection. Then the suffrage player and the opposition take turns playing cards from their hands. After six of these, the round is over and after six rounds the game ends in a sudden-death victory where players roll off to see which side wins any undecided states.;Most cards will be played for their events and most events allow you to add or remove cubes from states on the map. If you don’t want to play a card for its event then you can use it to campaign, which involves rolling a die for each campaigner on the map and allocating that many cubes to their surrounding area, or you can move them to a new one by paying a button. You can also play cards to get more buttons or to influence Congress to allow Americans a vote on suffrage: if Congress hasn’t done this by the time the game ends, the opposition player wins automatically.;Once Congress has passed that amendment then getting four of your cubes in a state “wins” it for you with a cross or a tick. The opposition player has fewer campaigners and cubes but only needs 13 states to reject suffrage in order to win. The suffrage player, meanwhile, is hampered by having to use two cube colors, reflecting the reality of racist factionalism within the movement. Prior to that, getting four cubes in certain critical states can win you an extra card associated with that state which you can play to advance your campaign.;If you assess Votes for Women purely from a mechanical standpoint, it uses a shocking amount of dice-rolling for a modern board game. Many event cards give you random amounts of cubes, as does campaigning. Committing cards to influence Congress, which is often what swings it over the line, requires rolling a six. The roll-off is particularly problematic: you get to add the number of cubes you have in the state but it’s still very prone to huge swings of fate and can often determine the winner on a single die roll. You might imagine that would make the game feel like a glorified crapshoot, yet it rarely does.;There are manifold reasons for this. A key one is the sheer amount of dice you roll over the course of the game, so your luck evens out. The fact the whole thing wraps in about 90 minutes helps, too. Another important aspect is the fact you can spend buttons to reroll, which makes fishing for sixes a bit less of a blunt instrument and gives you some control over other risk-against-reward decisions. It’s often so exciting to shake, with so much riding on the outcome, that you forget to worry about whether you’re making meaningful choices and roll with the drama as well as the dice.;This immersion is thanks largely to the game’s theme. While we happily play military simulations that slaughter thousands with a single card play, Votes for Women has such an astonishingly personal feel about it that it features excellent solo and cooperative versions for those who don’t want to play the opposition to suffrage. And it’s true: an opposition win feels thoroughly icky, whether you’re on the giving or receiving end. The root cause of this is that the game models systemic oppression rather than individual violence, and that the lingering effects of that systemic oppression are still being felt today.;For those who want to marshal their resources against that oppression, the game has plenty of tools to aid you. While there aren’t as many effects that link together as there perhaps might be, there are enough that experience with the deck will improve your game. Learning when to shepherd your buttons and when to spend them is critical, especially in the thrill of bidding for those powerful strategy cards. Knowing when to push the track for Congress over the tipping point proves a surprising double-edged sword for both sides and demands good judgement, as does when and where to campaign.;Votes for Women is based loosely on an older card-driven strategy board game called 1960: The Making of the President. This used the same state-wide board on which players added or removed cubes to each state but there was no geographical strategy, cubes just came and went like a tally and it felt like a missed opportunity. Votes for Women improves on its predecessor in almost every way but, despite the brief early importance of capturing particular states for special cards, it still has this nagging lack of spatial meaning and it still feels like a missed opportunity.;For more, check out our picks for the best trivia board games, the best roll-and-write board games, and the best three-player board games.', 'You’ll refight the struggle for women’s suffrage in America with cards and dice;It features excellent solo and cooperative versions for those who don’t want to play the opposition to suffrage')\n",

Chances are, though, that you’ll enjoy its tactical challenges as much as the visuals.', \"America is justly proud of its remaining areas of untamed wilderness, much of which is preserved through its national parks system. It’s been an inspiration to both artists and board game designers down the years, the latter giving us titles as diverse as hobby fare Cascadia to the much more mainstream National Parks-Opoly. But 2019's PARKS aims to give you the best of both worlds with some accessible tactical play married to art from the 59 Parks print series.;The stylized waterfall art of the PARKS box cover is a lovely piece of work, but it doesn’t prepare you for the treasures inside, making it a classic board game addition for any collector. Beneath the rules booklet, there are two custom trays of wooden components, suns and droplets, mountains and trees, all dyed in appealing pastel tones appropriate for a family board game. There are also a number of brown wildlife tokens, each and every one cut to resemble a different animal.;Underneath that there’s a plain tri-fold board and then at the bottom, there are several decks of cards, some large, some small. The largest cards are those for the national parks themselves. There’s no need for them to be so big except to showcase the glorious artwork from the 59 Parks print series that adorns each one. The smaller cards don’t have such impressive imagery but make up for it with little details like the fine layout and a lot of subtle gold shimmer to give them a luxurious feel.;You can see the same touches on the enamelled first player token, the wooden hiker pieces and all the counters you need to punch out, including board segments and a wonderful series of nature “photographs,” stylized in the same way as the park cards. Everything packs away neatly and securely in the sculpted tray that lines the bottom of the box. That tray showcases how much thought has gone into the physical design of PARKS and the results are delightful.;Your goal in PARKS is to steer a tag-team pair of hikers through as many of the biggest and most spectacular national parks as you can across four “seasons.” You do this by purchasing park cards from a face-up selection using the game’s four resources: the relatively common sun and water and the rarer forests and mountains. You can also get wildlife tokens which work as wild cards and can be spent in place of any resource. There's even a solo board game mode.;PARKS Expansions and More;A new board is constructed at random for each season out of the various board segments, making sure you have to vary your strategy a little every time. A season has an associated special effect, like gaining a bonus sun each time you get a forest, and a weather pattern which puts bonus resource markers on some of the segments. The first player to land on that segment gets the bonus alongside the special effects it provides to every visitor. These inbuilt effects mostly allow you to gain or swap resources.;So far, so ordinary. The tricksy thing about PARKS is that you’re allowed to move your hiker as far along the trail as you wish, but you can only go forward. So if there’s a space you particularly want, you’re caught in a conundrum between grabbing it now and skipping all the other useful spaces in between, or risking another player pipping you to the post. Of course, they’re all struggling with the same dilemma, too. You block a space you occupy although players can spend their campfire token to snuggle up to you if they want.;Campfire tokens are refreshed when your first hiker reaches the end of the trail, and this is your second problem. When you get there you can either use your resources to buy a park, spend sun tokens to buy gear which gives you future bonuses or discounts, or reserve a park card for your own future purchase and get the shiny first player token for the next round.;If you buy a card, which is the most common action, a new one gets added to the display. And this is both angsty and annoying at once. There’s a certain satisfaction in snatching a valuable card someone else has clearly been saving up for, and it adds to the strategies involved in pacing your hikers along the trail. But the fast turnover of cards and the random replacement tend to torpedo attempts at long-term strategy. PARKS is much more of a tactical affair.;You do get a choice of secret goal cards to work towards at the end of the game, like buying at least seven sun’s worth of gear, but these are so hard to achieve and give such paltry rewards that they rarely figure. Rather, strategy in this game is more about making sure you’ve got opportunities to get what you need. Mostly, these come from canteen cards. You start with one of the former and can gain more on certain spaces: they’re cards that cost one water to activate and get you either extra resources or the chance to exchange resources for other kinds.;Good play in PARKS is thus very much about knowing when to speed up and slow down on the trail to snaffle opportunities when they come your way. You’ll need to balance the time it takes to make use of your canteens and resource-swapping opportunities, with the flexibility it offers for the ever-changing makeup of cards on offer. You can also grab bonus points by taking photos in some spaces which cost two resources but then give you the camera. While you hold it, photos only cost one and you can take an extra snap at the end of each season. Knowing the right moment to steal the camera is yet another timing-based tactical decision you’ll need to add to your growing arsenal.;Despite the gorgeous presentation and the occasional thematic flourish, like the way the season card determines the weather, PARKS is an odd bird in terms of conveying its subject. There’s really nothing to link your open choice of destination or the constant turnover of park cards with the actual act of hiking. It’s really very abstract. Yet the game has such a wonderful visual evocation of the great outdoors that this actually feels vaguely confusing, as though there ought to be additional rules and game elements that simply aren’t there.;Want even more?

While the tinkering with its formula undertaken by its sequels has created more challenging games, none has captured the fine blend of accessibility and interactivity that makes it special. Despite a lack of moving parts that might make more dramatic or thematic games seem more appealing, it’s a title that should hold plenty of delights for gamers of almost every stripe.', 'Between its beautiful presentation, simplicity and depth there’s little doubt that Azul has earned its place as a modern classic.', 'Azul is named after azuleijos, the brightly coloured geometric tiles sported by beautiful buildings across North Africa and Portugal; the Portuguese learned to make them from the Moors. The board game has become a celebrated design in its own right, popular enough to launch several sequels which use the same core mechanics and the same beautiful printed plastic tiles. We’re revisiting the original to try and find out what makes this modern classic board game about decorating palace walls quite so compelling.;Like many other abstracts, Azul is a little short on the components front, but what it lacks in quantity, it more than makes up for in quality. Underneath the rules sheet, you’ll find four colorful, clear, sturdy playboards, one for each player. There are also a number of cardboard discs and some classic wooden cubes.;The most impressive eye candy is the piles of plastic tiles and the big cloth drawstring bag you keep them in. They’re an absolute delight: smooth and chunky, bright and colorful and some are embossed with intricate geometric designs. The game has them on display for full effect and they’re really satisfying to handle and rummage around in when you pull them from the bag.;Again, like many other abstracts Azul is a fairly simple game to get to grips with, although its slight oddity may prove a bit of a stumbling block. Each player gets a play board and a number of card circles, called factories, each of which starts with four tiles drawn at random from the bag. On your turn, you choose one of the factories, take all tiles of one matching color from it, and then place the rest in the centre of the table. After the first turn, this central offering is treated like another factory from which players can select tiles.;The tiles you’ve chosen go in one of the five rows of your playboard. You can put them in any row, which holds from one to five tiles, so long as a row doesn’t hold more than one color at once. If you do end up with tiles you can’t find on your play board then they “fall” to the bottom and smash, costing you penalty points.;This continues until all the tiles have been taken. Then from any rows that are full, you’re allowed to take a tile and transfer it to the same row on your wall, a grid of color-coded squares, on the matching colored space. That row can no longer hold tiles of that color. You’ll then score points depending on how many tiles are adjacent to the one that you’ve placed. After one player has completed a whole row of tiles, it’s time for final scoring where you get fat bonuses for having completed rows, columns or diagonals of the same color.;From this description, you might imagine Azul to be a somewhat humdrum affair, the kind of mediocre abstract that amuses for a few sessions before being forgotten. But it has a great deal more to it than the pretty face of its toothsome tiles. At first, it’s tempting to look at Azul purely from the perspective of filing lines efficiently: if there’s a trio of tiles, it makes sense to fit them into your three-long space. But because scoring each placement is based on adjacency, that’s a quick way to lose.;Instead, you’ll start to try and pick colours that fill rows and columns. And then you’re in the teeth of a dilemma because, of course, the need to fill lines efficiently is still a thing. If you don’t take that trio of tiles, then someone else might. So you begin to glance around at the boards of other players, frantically trying to second guess who’s going to pip you to the post on a pick you want, and how much following players might benefit if you leave particularly sweet groups for them and when you reach this point the game becomes really interesting.;Consider: unless you’re picking from the center, every pick you make radically changes the tiles on offer to other players because your discards end up in the middle. That might accidentally create a very valuable group for someone else. It might also spoil another player’s choices because they wanted a specific amount to fit onto their board and now there are too many, so if they take it they’ll smash the excess and take penalty points. Best of all, you might actually be laying a trap for following players because the restrictions caused by what they’ve already placed could force them into take a whole pile of tiles they can’t fit, merely to merrily smash on their floor alongside the tinkling amusement of their opponents.;All this to think about on every turn and we haven’t even reached trying to complete rows, columns and colors for bonus points. There really is a whole lot to Azul and what’s particularly joyous about it is how your choices impact those of your fellow players, often very strongly, without a whiff of zero-sum interaction where what makes one player stronger makes another weaker. The game is well-balanced, deep and, unless you can calculate all the probabilities a dozen moves ahead, often quite exciting as you wait to see what the other players leave you, which is why it made our list of the best three player board games.;Against this, there is a certain degree of repetition to consider. From a thematic standpoint, this is essentially a game about tiling walls, hardly the most thrilling and dramatic subject matter for a clash of minds. There aren’t a lot of moving parts to Azul which, even though it makes the relative depth of strategy all the more impressive, doesn’t give you the variety many players want to sustain interest over a prolonged period of plays, so perhaps best with a rotating cast of players as a party board game. Those who can maintain focus on a single game, however, will find a lot to reward them.;Azul has earned a spot on our list of the best family board games.

But it’s clear from the success of the game that its delightful components and appealing theme are more than enough to get many players to take the plunge. And, once there, they’re won over by the absorbing and addictive strategies on offer.', 'Wingspan is a more complicated game than its popularity might suggest, but players will likely be won over by the charming theme, plus the absorbing and addictive strategies on offer.', 'Every once in a while a board game comes along that, while designed by and for enthusiasts, breaks the mold and reaches a wider audience. Wingspan is one of the most phenomenal success stories of this elite brigade. Created by first-time designer and bird enthusiast Elizabeth Hargrave, this game about building wildlife reserves has gone on to sell well over a million copies across multiple printings, making it one of the most successful and best board games of recent years.;Wingspan is crammed full of stuff, most of which is delightfully designed to evoke its ornithological theme. There are a lot of cards, most of which represent species of birds, embellished with luminous art and educational factoids alongside their pertinent game information. All the cards can be put away in the supplied plastic storage tray with an embossed bird on the lid.;Food items like grain and mice are printed on wooden dice which, in turn, are rolled and kept in a wonderful dice tower and tray that looks like a birdhouse. There are also matching food tokens for you to keep until spent when you take a die. This board game for adults includes four plastic trays in which you can keep these tokens and the huge array of three-dimensional pastel-colored bird eggs.;Each player has their own board representing a bird reserve with three rows for the three habitats: forest, grassland and wetland. The box contents are rounded out with various extras like cubes to track player turns, scoresheets, rules and reference material. It’s a delightful package and a lot of thought has gone into the production and overall design. Even the rulebooks are sturdy, textured paper and everything stacks tightly in the box to minimise the risk of spillage during storage.;This is an example of an old design concept in classic board games, that of circular dependencies. To play bird cards you need food, eggs, and the cards themselves. However, to increase your access to those three resources you need to have bird cards in your forest, grasslands, and wetlands respectively. It’s all about trying to dovetail the growing ability of your reserve to support birds with the special powers of the birds that live there in order to score points in the most efficient manner.;Birds have favored habitats and particular food requirements. On your turn, you can either play one into a habitat if you have the necessary food or you can “activate” a habitat instead. This gets you some of the matching resources. The forest allows you to select food dice from the birdhouse dice tower and take matching food tokens. Grasslands give you eggs which are needed to play beyond the first slot in any habitat. The wetlands give you new cards, chosen either from a face-up selection or a random face-down card.;Importantly, activating a habitat also activates the special powers of the birds you have played there. These are very varied and combine with the wider game mechanics in all sorts of interesting ways. The Common Grackle, for instance, lets you tuck a card from your hand behind it, making it worth more points and giving you a bonus egg. The Great Crested Flycatcher allows you to take an invertebrate food token if there’s a matching dice in the birdhouse. You can see how powers like these force you to think about the order of your choices and what other resources are available in trying to ensure you get the best effect out of each activation.;Weirdly, this is essentially building a bird reserve as an economic engine. The more birds you have the more resources you’ll get and the more special powers you’ll fire on each activation. It’s really satisfying to watch your reserve grow and thrive and to work out the best combinations of play before seeing them come into full effect. There’s excitement too, not only to see if the random roll of food dice or draw of cards will help or hinder your overall strategy but also the anticipation of watching your plan come together.;What there isn’t is much in the way of interaction. This is very much about how you plan and execute your strategies compared to the success of other players, which can be appealing in a family board game. For the most part, you only need to worry about what they’re doing in terms of them getting food or cards you might want before your turn comes around. A few bird cards rely on other people’s effects: vultures, for instance, gain food when predatory birds in other reserves hunt successfully. But such cards are relatively rare and are still more spectator sport than a direct duel.;Your semi-solitaire dance, however, is incredibly absorbing. There are so many different bird effects -- some of which come into effect when played or between turns rather than on activation -- that building a cohesive strategy is a tough ask. And that’s before you’ve looked at the competing demands of each habitat supplying better rewards as it grows, all of which you’ll need to obtain in order to play more birds. Finally, for some extra spice, each of the four turns in the game has a fiercely contested mini-goal for bonus points, like having the most birds in the grasslands. Each player also has one or more secret goals, such as collecting a certain number of grain-eating birds, for more points.;The ultimate goal is to take the various resources and convert them into points in an optimal manner. Most of your points will come from the bird cards themselves and it’s quite easy to tie yourself in knots trying to get the prerequisites for an expensive card in the most cost-effective way, only to find out you’ve run out of actions.  Every decision you make in Wingspan is so well interwoven with multiple other aspects of the game that it feels like an impossible balancing act to try and get it right. But it’s also fairly transparent when you inevitably go wrong, making each play an addictive learning experience where you’re sure you’ll do better next time.;For more, check out our picks for the best board games for kids, the best deck-building board games, and the best board games for 5 year olds.', None)\n",

This gives it a very wide appeal to newcomers and longtime board game fans.', 'What if dragons weren’t all massive, dangerous beasts intent on kidnapping maidens, eating livestock, and stealing gold? What if, instead, they were small, friendly creatures who delighted in using their fiery breath to help humans in tasks like cooking and metalworking? That’s how they’re portrayed in the world of Flamecraft, a board game in which players represent Flamekeepers, people skilled in attracting, training, and placing these artisanally skilled drakes in shops and craft establishments. It’s down to you to grow your reputation and resources by making good matches between dragons and their new owners in the hope of being named the Master of Flamecraft.;There’s no board in Flamecraft: instead, the action unfolds on a neoprene mat that’s rolled up to store in the box. This mat is over a meter long when unrolled, which may be too much for smaller tables. Fortunately, you can play the game perfectly well without it, as it’s only used for organising the other components and tracking scores. It does look great on the table though, representing a shopping street with a fountain and park.;Most of the rest of the contents are cards of various sorts. There’s a deck of large shop cards and two decks of dragons: artisans, who work in the shop and “fancy” dragons that score you extra points. All of the cards are well illustrated in a compelling style that’s cute and cartoonish but also rich and detailed all at the same time.;Resources are represented by cardboard tokens you’ll need to punch out. The player pieces and score markers are wood, shaped like dragons and hearts respectively. They’re brightly colored and printed and are great to handle and use in play.;Flamecraft starts out delightfully and deceptively simple. You begin with six starter shop cards on the table, and on your turn you choose one to visit. Once there you can either collect resources from the shop, like bread from the bakers, or enchant it to get points and other rewards. Both mean that future visitors to the shop will get access to additional resources, so you’re making it more attractive to other players.;Gathering resources from a shop also lets you leave a dragon from your hand there for an additional reward. If there are dragons working in the shop you can claim a “flame” bonus from one of them, such as the three extra resources available from a diamond dragon. Once the three slots in a shop are full, a new one is drawn from the shop deck and added to the street. These new shops offer special abilities to visitors: the Drake of Cakes, for instance, lets you pay two bread to draw a new dragon into your hand.;Enchantments, on the other hand, cost a slew of resources but also net you a bigger reward, mostly in the form of points, which you’ll need to win the game. Enchanting a shop also bags you the flame rewards for all dragons at the location. A smattering of points are available for placing dragons but the other major source of points is fancy dragons. You can draw these during the game, and each has a condition that can be checked either during play or game end to get a bonus. Bubu, for example, gives you points if you don’t have too many resources left over when the game finishes.;When you first start playing Flamecraft, this seems like a straightforward, but fun, puzzle. You’ll look at your starting fancy dragon and the available enchantments to try and work out what resources you need. These, alongside the dragons in your hand that you can place, will determine your choice of destination. At the same time, you’ll be watching what other players are collecting and try not to leave dragons and enchantments behind that help them gather the resources they need. While the rules are easy, the challenges they pose are not, making this a fun board game for small parties.;The game is, essentially, a race. Anyone can claim a face-up enchantment, so you’re trying to gather the necessary resources and put one into play before anyone else. But if you race too hard you won’t get such a good flame bonus, as the shop won’t be full of dragons: they need to be placed first. But the gains for posting dragons vary between shops and slots, so some are more tempting than others, especially when you factor in the special powers offered by later shops. Timing is critical as you flit around, trying to balance the rewards for leaving dragons without making a shop too much of a tasty target for someone else to enchant before you do.;While you can’t mess with the other players directly, the need to watch what they’re doing very closely makes it feel quite interactive, and there’s real resentment if someone else snatches a card you were angling to buy. There’s also a common reward option that lets you get points by gifting resources to other players, a clever idea that puts positive interaction into the game. Both parties profit, so there’s lots of pleading as you decide who gets to benefit from your largesse, although ultimately you’ll be trying to pick the player it helps the least. This aspect is lost if you attempt the otherwise enjoyable solo board game version, which has achievements you can tick off to vary your game if you manage the tough ask of meeting the score requirements.;As players collect more fancy dragons from shop rewards and new shops come onto the table, though, the puzzle deepens. Each brings new nuance to your decisions, a slow drip of increasing options that enrich the formula so slowly that you barely notice until, toward the end game, you suddenly realize you’re juggling dozens of competing goals to squeeze out the most points. Trying to figure out the best options in these late stages, in an ever-changing game state with other players snaffling up enchantments and filling dragon slots, is a dynamic challenge -- but it can be critical in determining the winner.;Ultimately, this board game for adults is about converting resources directly into points and however much you throw into that formula, it won’t ever be deep enough to satisfy die-hard fans of strategy board games.;For more like this, check out our roundups of the best quick-playing board games, the best three-player board games, and the best board games for kids.', 'Flamecraft starts out delightfully and deceptively simple')\n",

If you can’t get five people around a table regularly, this isn’t going to be a game for you and even with four, you notice the absence of the Nomad. If you can manage that, and you’re happy with unfettered negotiation and alliances, Crescent Moon will light up your game night, easier and faster to teach and play than its peers while offering just as much enjoyment.', '', 'Asymmetric games, where each player has access to different abilities and ways of scoring points, are very much in vogue right now. That’s partly down to the success of cute animal tyranny simulator Root (which you can find in our roundup of the best war board games). But it’s not a new concept -- it’s just very hard to design and still retain a balanced board game for adults. The latest entry in this niche is Crescent Moon, a quasi-historical game based on feuding factions in the medieval near East (see it on Amazon).;Before you even lift the lid on Crescent Moon the game is already trying to impress you with its production quality. The box art is fluid and lavish and surrounded by a gold trim. At first glance, the contents don’t seem to live up to that promise. There are some sheets of tokens to punch and some cardboard hexes to unwrap alongside a bag of wooden components and a deck of cards.;When you take a closer look at what you’ve got, the magic comes back. The cards and hexes bear the same style of art as the box cover and the wooden buildings are printed with doors and windows, some even shaped with curving minarets. As a nice touch, each faction has a printed drawstring bag to store its pieces in.;Assembled on the table it’s a striking thing, full of pastel tones and curious shapes. You assemble the map from the provided hexes according to one of a number of suggestions in the back of the book or pieced together at random. Then units and tokens are placed atop it and you’re ready to begin.;Approaching an asymmetric game is always a little nerve-wracking. With different rules for each player, it can be a lot to learn, as well as hard to understand how all the pieces fit together to make a whole board game experience. Although moderately complex, Crescent Moon is more accessible than many of its peers, thanks to two things. First, all the players choose from the same palette of actions, it’s just that each faction only has access to a subset of them. Second, there’s a helpful set of player aids which include an outline of what each faction does and how it plays.;There are five factions to choose from, as befits a game that supports four to five players, each with its own objectives. The Caliph is a militaristic ruler who can build forests and castles on the cheap and seeks to subdue and control territory. The Sultan is an economic leader who can sell cards to other players and wins by founding prosperous towns and cities. The Warlord cannot build structures, but gets points for sweeping in and ransacking those of other players. Finally, the Murshid is a peddler of influence who interferes in other players’ conflicts and scores by spreading their reputation.;You may have noticed that’s only four: that’s because those are the core of the four-player experience. With a fifth player, the additional faction that enters play is the Nomad. They’re distinctive for being able to raise military units wherever they want and also for cashing in coins for victory points. But more interestingly they’re also able to hire out mercenaries to other players: indeed this is the only way the Sultan and the Murshid can get troops at all. In a four-player game cash for mercenaries goes to the bank, whereas with five it goes into the Nomad’s pockets.;This setup tells you a great deal about the kind of game that Crescent Moon wants to be. Every faction is, at least with five, in thrall to another faction to some extent. Card purchases enrich other players, especially the Sultan. Aggression risks the Murshid getting involved and tipping the scales one way or another. And if you want mercenaries at all you’d better stay on good terms with the Nomad, a key reason why this game is much more enjoyable with the full complement of five and making it a good board game for parties.;The key to success, then, is making deals. In keeping your enemies close and your friends closer. But with all the interdependencies in the game, this isn’t a simple matter of maintaining a peace pact until it becomes inconvenient and someone gets stabbed in the back, although you can take that route as part of your plans. In Crescent Moon, you have to forgive and forget to some extent because you’ll always need something that someone else is offering. It’s a much more subtle and realistic take on factional negotiation.;While networking may be key to your overall success, that doesn’t mean that the game is lacking in crunchy strategy. The core of this is the game’s peculiar differentiation between control, influence and presence in each map hex. The first is the standard state of having military forces there. The second is a token which indicates that your faction has a cultural or social stake in the area. The third simply indicates that you have something in the hex: influence or some kind of building. These three states mean that you can spread your power across the map in different ways. If your troops are blocked, you can still peddle influence or construction.;However, the way the factions interconnect can sometimes feel like a straightjacket, especially if other players don’t interact with you the way the game expects, such as no one wanting to buy the Sultan’s cards. Every faction is clear on what it wants to do and has specific ways to score points. So while there’s always a route to advance your goals somehow, it can be frustrating to find you’re blocked from making optimal plays. There’s also limited room for creative strategies because you’re boxed in by your faction goals. To some extent, this is all true of every asymmetric negotiation game but Crescent Moon feels more brittle than most.;Influence and control can both be contested in different ways. Combat is a straight-up calculation of the player with the most powerful forces in the hex. Influence contests are more complex, factoring in all types of pieces in the contested area and, deliciously, allowing multiple players to get involved, declaring support for the attacker or the defender. In both cases, there’s a chance to select cards in secret first which adds the needed uncertainty for an exciting conflict.;For more, check out our picks for the best board games for couples, the best Marvel board games, and the best trivia board games.', 'Although moderately complex, Crescent Moon is more accessible than many of its peers;The key to success is making deals--in keeping your enemies close and your friends closer')\n",

Different setups for the sniper’s equipment and the German specialities, plus the double-sided board, gives the game plenty of replay value too. And while it lacks the distance and freedom of an open world, the cramped corners and shadowy corridors of the board prove every bit as exciting, and better suited to your table.', 'Sniper Elite: The Board Game is a short, simple, and smartly designed hidden movement game.', 'Once upon a time, a lone American sniper single-handedly won the Second World War. At least that’s the case if you’ve played any of the Sniper Elite series of video games. Now, Rebellion has bought its digital IP to the tabletop so that you, too, can guide a single super-powered stealth sniper to victory against three squads of German defenders (see it at Amazon). Or this time, in order to ensure it’s a competitive game, the Germans might actually win.;While there’s no ray-tracing or gory kill-cams in the transition to tabletop, you do get 10 ink-washed military miniatures to play with instead, and they’re still excellent eye candy. Nine slot into three sets of colored bases to represent German squads, each with an officer. The other is the sniper himself for the times he’s visible on the board.;They’re set up on a board that shows a submarine pen on one side and a launching facility on the other. The maps are well-drawn with clear walls, elevation and iconography to facilitate smooth play. There are also two mini-maps for the sniper to move on in secret and a poor-quality dry wipe pen to mark his path.;Some bags of plastic cubes and decks of cards round out the component manifest. One deck is for sniper weapons, one for speciality soldiers, one for solo board game play, and the final deck is for sniper objectives. They’re all good quality and in a nice touch, the objective deck is printed to make it look like the kind of playing cards used by allied intelligence to send information to prisoners of war.;Sniper Elite is an asymmetrical hidden movement game. One player controls the sniper character, who deploys in secret and moves off-map to try and reach two randomly-drawn objective spaces on the board. The others control the German defenders whose job it is to hunt down and either kill or delay the sniper so that the turn count runs down before he can complete those objectives.;While up to three players can control German squads, it’s perhaps best played one on one, making it a great board game for couples. Two German players have to share a squad, while three runs the risk of one player bossing the others around.;If the sniper moves more than one space and there’s an adjacent guard, he has to alert his opponents that they’ve heard a noise. In their turn, their roster of actions includes spot and search. The former lets them specify a single space and the sniper must reveal if they’re there. With the latter, they can nominate three spaces and the sniper has to say if they’re in one of them, but not which. A squad can also sacrifice both its actions to do a sweep that tells them whether the sniper is in the same board region.;This is the basic dynamic that drives the game. The sniper has 10 turns to complete one objective and then another ten for the second. Given the convoluted walls and doors of the two maps, the sniper will be a minimum of seven or eight spaces from any objectives at the start of the game. So even under ideal circumstances, creeping along one space per turn will leave them very tight time pressure. And the longer they take, the longer the Germans can use those spot and search actions to pinpoint the sniper. Every passing turn escalates the tension for both sides.;To try and clear a path and reduce the number of enemy actions, the sniper can, of course, snipe. This uses an odd mechanic where you announce how many tokens you’re drawing from a bag, needing as many aim tokens as there are spaces to the target. But alongside those tokens are recoil tokens, which are duds, and noise tokens which can reveal your position. Certain conditions add tokens to the bag, like completing your first objective, which adds a noise token to indicate the heightened state of alert.;While drawing tokens is tense and the blind pull is a good way of simulating the possibility of noise attracting attention, the boards are simply too small for this to feel like sniping. There’s nothing like the open-world feeling of the video games: instead, you’ll tend to favour short-range shots in cramped spaces to reduce the number of tokens drawn. As a result, it’s rare that a result of a shot is in doubt. Instead, the major risk is revealing your position which, while exciting, feels a bit of a missed opportunity.;Shooting, however, is only one part of the board game, and in all other aspects Sniper Elite: The Board Game delivers handsomely. This is old-fashioned hidden movement done very well, with the sniper being cornered and slipping away into the darkness over and over, unlike the slow burn puzzle of Mind MGMT.;Thanks to the hidden information, both sides grapple with the constant sense they’re only one step away from losing. The sniper player is under too much time pressure and must take constant risks of giving away clues, but it’s up to them what risks to take. The German players, meanwhile, have to use these crumbs of information to close in, block key routes and hurt the sniper or run down the clock.;To add to the fun, both sniper and German squads get speciality cards from a decent number of options to vary things up. For the sniper, it’s things like an S-Mine which they can place in secret on their map and which kills any unfortunate German solider that blunders into it. They, in turn, have squad specialities, like a medic that can keep a soldier shot by the sniper in place and on the board twice per game. There’s even a German sniper that can shoot back using the sniper’s shot bag.

Most have been exactly the kind of fun adventure or conquest titles you’d associate with the license. But the range also includes a couple of deeper strategy board game titles, including 2016’s Tyrants of the Underdark (see it on Amazon).;Players represent noble houses of dark elves, spreading their malicious influence through the dark underworld caverns. To do this they build up their own deck of cards by buying new ones from a face-up selection, a mechanic known as deck-building. Now the game is back in a spanking new edition that includes the Aberrations & Undead expansion, giving you even more cards to play with and making our list of the best deck-building board games.;The original edition came with miniature plastic shields to represent your forces on the board. These have been replaced here by cardboard discs. It’s a minor loss which leaves the game a little less visually spectacular but a lot more compact and affordable.;The board the tokens go on is plain but functional, showing a series of interconnected areas via the medium of lines and circles. Everything is purple, black, and white, which is thematic but can make things hard to distinguish. There are also four player boards and a market board to hold stacks of cards.;Beneath the board are lots of cards, also with purple backs and unnecessarily emblazoned with the word \"Minion.\" However, the game excels with the card fronts on which all the information is laid out clearly around some classic Dungeons & Dragons art. With the game’s long history there’s plenty of fantastic art for all the people and monsters depicted in the game, and full use is made of the back catalogue to bring proceedings to life.;On your turn, you draw and play five cards from your deck. The majority provide either influence, which you can use to buy more cards to add to your deck, or power, an abstraction of military prowess. One power can be spent to deploy a token to an area adjacent to an existing token. Three will let you destroy an adjacent enemy token, either from an opposing player or one of the white “neutral” tokens that litter the board in the beginning. It’s a compact, accessible framework.;Your goal in doing so is to have a majority of troops in key locations that will score you points at the end of the game. Some of these represent major cities which will net you bonus influence or even points as soon as you take control. Needless to say, these are hard to gain purchase in, and hotly contested. You’ll stretch your soldiers out from a start point, balancing controlling locations with speed of spread, racing your opponents to choke points. There’s real tension in waiting to see how the map will change before your turn comes round.;The secret to Tyrants of the Underdark’s success is that location points are only one possible source of points. You can also score by knocking out enemy tokens and by the action of some cards. Indeed, the cards themselves are also worth points when the game ends. Instead of destroying cards from your deck, like most deck builders, here you “promote” them which gets them out of your deck and set to one side, making them worth additional points in the final tally.;Together, these straightforward concepts provide a dizzying array of methods to approach the game. At one extreme you could go all-out conquest, stuffing your deck with military cards and hoping to overwhelm your rivals before their strategies can get going. Running out of tokens ends the game, making this a viable tactic. On the other, you might ramp up your influence to gain more and more powerful cards, levering promotions and points to compensate for a weak map presence.;In practice, your choices are steered by the random selection cards available to buy on your turn, forcing you to dabble in the game’s various machinations. It’s a potent recipe, making you think on your feet, upping the ante as each new card becomes available, while still allowing you to decide how to shape your strategy. No two games are going to play out the same and your potential route to victory will be different each time. At the same time, the random deal can sometimes leave you short of workable choices or deliver a killer combo to an opponent.;Many cards extend the basic formula of influence and power. And a good job too, as the back and forth of kicking off an enemy unit, then adding one of your own, only to see an opponent repeat the moves, can get a little wearing. Most common are those that bring spies into the mix, units that can be placed anywhere on the board, then sacrificed later for a powerful bonus.;But this is a Dungeons & Dragons game, and the cards represent the breadth of that famous game’s world-building. Each game has two half-decks to source cards for the players to buy: the rules suggest you start with Dark Elves and Dragons. They chime in with the game’s core mechanics: the former tend toward providing influence and opportunities to promote your cards, whereas the latter deal more in raw power. They run the gamut from feeble underlings to mighty Drow Matriarchs and Ancient Wyrms, hugely satisfying to add to your deck and play.;These are only two of the possible ways to build the market. Other half decks include Demons, which you can buff by sacrificing your own cards, and Elementals whose Focus keyword lets you stack related cards for big bonuses. The two half-decks from the Aberrations & Undead expansion included here are less well-differentiated but still lots of fun to play with. And each is packed with iconic monsters from the role-playing game’s bestiary to recruit and serve your cause.;Tyrants of the Underdark has an MSRP of $74.99 and is available at a handful of retailers.;For more, check out our picks for the best horror board games, the best three-player board games, and the best Star Wars board games.', 'There’s real tension in waiting to see how the map will change before your turn comes round;No two games are going to play out the same')\n",

But if you’re in the market for a deep yet dynamic game, Brian Boru’s sheer innovation and elegance make it worth your while.', 'If you’re in the market for a deep yet dynamic game, Brian Boru’s sheer innovation and elegance make it worth your while.', 'Trick-taking is a central part of so many playing card games that most people are familiar with it. The lead player starts by playing a card and the highest card of that suit wins the hand. Yet it’s not used that widely in hobby games, perhaps because it’s so commonplace, despite the fact it would make games easier to learn.;Enter Brian Boru: High King of Ireland, a game named after a renowned king of medieval Ireland (see it on Amazon). It uses that comfortable trick-taking concept but builds on it in two distinct ways. First, it removes much of the randomness by having players draft cards instead of a random deal. Second, it has the outcome of tricks determine your control of towns on a map of Ireland. Between them, these innovations transform the humble trick into something very new and interesting, and earn their way on to our list of the best board games for adults.;Brian Boru comes in a big, shallow box in order to accommodate a large board with some tracks and a map of Ireland with major towns marked and linked by roads. It’s a beautiful thing, painted in gentle tones to suggest an ancient chart and decorated with knotwork and Celtic fonts.;Indeed the artwork across the game is high quality. You can see the same effect on the cards which are big, tarot-sized affairs depicting people, places and items relevant to the era in classic knotwork borders in addition to their in-game information.;Both board and cards are thick with icons, which fit the style of the game but are a little hard to decipher until you’re familiar with the rules. The components are rounded out with some punchboards of tokens and a set of wooden discs in five different player colors, though it can be played with as little as three players.;The core of Brian Boru is the card draft and trick-taking, which is easy to come to grips with. First, each player is dealt a hand of cards from which they choose two and pass the rest on to the next player. This is repeated until everyone gets a full hand. It’s a clever way to start out, giving a seed of randomness and variety but still offering interesting choices for the players to make.;Cards have a number that ranges from one to 25, and two or three groups of icons. The topmost icons indicate actions you get to take when you win a trick with that card and always include taking control of a town. The lower sets gain you resources, and you can choose one if you play that card into a trick and don’t win. This adds some interesting wrinkles in deciding which losing card to throw into a trick.;There are four colors of cards, each of which offers compensation actions that link to a wider aspect of the game. Red allows you to battle the Viking incursions that plagued Ireland in this era through the abstract concept of taking Viking tokens. Yellow advances you on the marriage track as you seek to secure your noble family with advantageous unions. Blue lets you sway the church in the hope of gaining monasteries that increase your on-board influence. All the cards also let you gain money, and this is the only option on the final color, white, which is wild and can be played as a color of your choice.;This sets up a fascinating series of interlocking decisions to wrestle with as you try to win tricks, like a serpentine Celtic ouroboros eating its own tail. The biggest source of the points you need to win is by placing towns on the map: you get points for both having the most towns in an area and for having towns across as many areas as possible.;You can also score well by fighting Vikings with the added incentive that the player with the least Viking tokens is at risk of having a town taken over by the raiders. They’ll be spared, however, if all the invading tokens for the round are defeated. Sometimes it’s worth holding off on defeating Vikings in order to ensure someone gets pillaged. This can provide some real terror toward the end of each round as you wait to see who, if anyone, is going to be for the chop.;Yet neglecting the other areas is dangerous. Money is often required to place towns from a winning trick. You can often place a town from a losing trick too if you’ve got the cash to pay more and connect it to an existing town you control via a road. Going up the marriage track nets you some nice bonuses each round and can be a game-winner at the conclusion. Given that area control is often tight, gaining monasteries from the church to boost your influence can win you whole areas.;Whoever gains the most influence in the church each round also gets to lead all the tricks in the following round. This is a fascinating double-edged sword. A trick starts with the lead player choosing a town on the board to compete for, which lets them focus on areas they want to win and keep others away from places already under their control. But by playing the first card they’re at higher risk of being beaten by the following plays.;Trying to track what’s gone and what you’re likely to win, while also factoring in the town you’re playing for, your cash, Vikings, and position on the church and marriage can feel like being at the controls of an airliner. It’s all laid out clearly before you, but there’s so much to consider that it’s horrifically easy to make major errors in the heat of the moment. (For more high stakes decision-making, see our list of the best strategy board games.);Once you’re behind, it can be difficult to catch up. This is exacerbated by the way Brian Boru puts you in full control of your decisions but still leaves you at the mercy of the unexpected. While there’s little randomness, you can’t plan for whether other players will over or under-bid you on a trick, as it will depend on what resources they need and risks they take. So you can work hard to gain position, only to see it ruined by an unexpected play, which is very frustrating.;Once the dynamic trick-taking is over, there’s a clean up phase where you see who’s won each aspect of the game that turn and dole out points accordingly. This is tiresome and fiddly, and your first couple of games won’t be helped by some unclear rules.

You start with three terrain hexes, each of which has icons indicating which of the five kinds of animals can live there. On your turn you choose one of four randomly drawn pairs of hex and animal counter to add to your map. You can place them where you like: the only caveat is that the animal has to go on a hex that supports it. That’s it.;Of course if that’s really all there was to it, Cascadia wouldn’t be much fun at all. But it’s amazing how a few basic frills to this formula make the game explode with possibilities while leaving it very easy to learn. Your goal is to score points, and you get points in two ways. First by keeping terrain types together, making that open placement less flexible than it appears. And second by obeying the animal scoring cards you’re using that game.;There’s a whole deck of these scoring cards. At their simplest there are two family versions which give you points for keeping groups of the same animal together. These are a bit too straightforward to sustain adult interest, but the fact they make Cascadia playable for kids shows just how accessible the game is. In the full version you’ll use one card for each of the five animal types, giving you different rewards for how they’re arranged.;Each animal follows broad stereotypes. Bears like to live in family groups, so their cards give you points for groups of two, or of three, or a combination of both. Foxes, meanwhile, rely on prey species so reward you depending on the mix of animals in adjacent hexes. Eagles like to be solitary, elk in big herds and salmon to make long runs. With three different scoring conditions for each animal, there are plenty of combinations to keep the game varied.;Now, selecting from those four pairs of animals and hexes doesn’t seem anywhere near so straightforward. Every pick needs to key in to whether it can score you points for the terrain and for how you place animals on your map. Often the two are in opposition, and it’s down to you to judge which to prioritize based on how long there is to go in the game and what other people are collecting. Elk might score you big points for a big herd, but if other players are competing to hoover up the elk discs, you’d be wise to specialize elsewhere.;Despite the fact you need to remain aware of other player’s actions, Cascadia is otherwise a rather lonely affair. You’re focussed on what you’re collecting and there’s no direct interaction with other players. On the positive side that means it plays well solo and minimizes friction during family play. On the negative, especially given that it’s entirely a tactical game, it can make the time between turns drag. It’s fast playing, so this is really only an issue with a full complement of four players, in fact earning a place on our list of the best three player games.;As long as the turns keep coming fast enough there’s a certain pleasure in wondering what you’ll get to select from during your turn. Maybe it’ll be that last salmon you need for a big score, maybe it won’t. While the tactical focus means you can’t plan ahead, it does keep everyone constantly on their toes. You’ll often be rewarded for keeping your map flexible enough to pivot to different scoring chances if the ones you’re chasing don’t come off. It results in a surprising amount of excitement for such a low interaction game.;There’s plenty in the standard game to engage you for many plays, but Cascadia offers players even more to keep them interested. In the back of the brief rulebook there are three charts offering achievements to complete. One set is scenarios, getting past point thresholds with particular combinations of scoring cards and criteria. The second involves playing a normal game for a specific goal, like not having a particular animal on your map. The third involves minor rule variations like having three, rather than four, hex and animal token sets to choose from. These offer fantastic variety and add a particular spice to solo play, giving you fun escalating challenges to beat rather that repeat plays for a high score.;Some of the terrain hexes will only support a single species, and if you place here you get a pinecone as a reward. You can either cash these in for a point at the end of the game or, during the selection, to take an animal and a hex from different pairs. This is a nice diversification of the strategy but it does highlight that however rich the art, this is an abstract puzzle. There’s no connection to any real-life activity or situation during your in-game decisions.;For more, check out our roundups the best campaign board games, the best quick playing board games, and the best board games for 5 year olds.', 'With three different scoring conditions for each animal, there are plenty of combinations to keep the game varied;While the tactical focus means you can’t plan ahead, it does keep everyone constantly on their toes')\n",

As a game system, it’s a bit harder to call: the range of expansions suggest it has the potential for long term focus, but it doesn’t quite have the depth to support that. However, when it’s free to try online and both the boxed options make great games in their own right, that’s hardly a major black mark.', \"Summoner Wars 2nd edition works great as a standalone board game. It may stumble a little as a game system, but that's easy to forgive.\", 'We’re all familiar with two-player card games where you summon minions and queue them up before you like some doughty phalanx. But any similarity with a real battle line ends when you make abstract clashes of card against card. The real game is in building your deck, finding combos and managing your hand.;Summoner Wars (See it on Amazon) takes the deck building, the combos, the hand management and adds a simple, massive twist. Instead of a queue, the two of you put your minions on board and fight it out in a real tactical battle, like the best war board games. It was revolutionary when it first came out in 2009: now it’s back in a tight new edition.;There are two ways you can start out with Summoner Wars: the Master Set and the Starter Set. Both contain dice, a board, and some decks of cards. In the Starter Set, you get two decks and the board is thick paper that you’ll want to weigh down beneath some plexiglass. In the Master Set, you get a sturdy mounted board and six decks. Those six don’t include the two in the Starter Set.;All the art has been redone for this new edition, moving from classical fantasy realism toward a more cartoon style. Whether that you find this a positive change is a matter of individual taste, although the newer art seems better quality and is perhaps better suited to the tone of the game.;You start out in Summoner Wars with a handful of cards on the board, including your Summoner, a powerful unit in its own right, and a Gate. These are scenery cards that block squares and provide a location next to which you can summon new cards. To do so, you need to spend points from a limited pool of magic, which you can top up either by killing enemy units or discarding your own cards.;This dilemma, that you can only gain power now by sacrificing the potential for power later, is the central fulcrum on which the game rests. And it’s a doozy, a tottering see-saw with a drop into oblivion at one end. Because once your deck is gone, it’s gone: there are no reshuffles here, you’ll just be left clinging on to the game by whatever meagre forces you’ve got left on the board. The goal is to kill the enemy Summoner and if the only tool remaining to do that is your own Summoner then so be it.;Within that core consideration, there are a number of tactical decisions. Depending on their utility, cards from your hand will cost different amounts of points to summon onto the board. Each deck has several Champions which are very powerful cards, but they’re also very expensive. Whether it’s worth discarding large numbers of rank and file in order to summon them is a tough call.;Summoner Wars keeps things simple by giving all units the same basic set of rules: you can activate a maximum of three cards per turn, which can move two squares and have a range of three for spells and missile weapons. They differ in the amount of health they have and the dice they throw in combat. This second edition opts for custom dice that either hit or miss with ranged attacks being a little less reliable than melee. And even this simple set of strictures offers some tactical meat to chew. The Phoenix Elves’ Royal Guardian, for example, has four health but throws one pitiful melee dice. He’s best used to pick off already injured foes or for blocking their movement.;However, there’s a lot more to take into account when you start looking at the special powers each unit has. Our Royal Guardian has two: he can push units one square away in combat, and any adjacent units that move away from him take a point of damage. That’s a combo in itself, of course, meaning he’s more dangerous than his single die suggests, but only if his target has space to be pushed. That’s not always the case during tense melees in the crowded center of the board.;But there’s more. In addition to unit cards, your deck also contains events and one-shot special cards that influence the game. The Phoenix Elves have one, also called Phoenix, that adds an extra point of damage from non-attack sources, such as that of the Guardian and some of their other cards. If you can set things up so it triggers multiple times in a turn, it’s extremely powerful. Their summoner also has a recall ability that lets her move other cards next to her as a bulwark against enemy attacks, another role the Guardian excels at.;As you can see, each deck is carefully designed to have mutually supporting cards. Learning how to use them together to best effect takes a couple of games. And that’s on top of the basic board positioning as you maneuver for advantage: a cunning player can use that push ability to shove enemy cards into the attack corridors of other units to finish them off, for example.;It all comes together as a delicious smorgasbord of turn by turn tactical decision making. Even when you’ve learned to wield a deck well, there’s still plenty of excitement and uncertainty from the dice and card draw to keep you on your toes. And when you tire of that, Summoner Wars allows you a limited form of deck building where you can mix and match cards from different factions and make something new to master.;You can add new ingredients, too, in the form of individual expansion decks you can purchase. Summoner Wars also has a fantastic online client where you can play Starter Set games against the AI for free. Both decks and client are being updated for this new edition, which doesn’t make major gameplay changes. Instead, it makes things clearer and tighter while incentivizing aggressive play.;Despite the thrills and spills of tactical play, Summoner Wars can sometimes be bedeviled by a sense that it too often boils down to the last card. If your deck is empty and your opponent’s deck is not, it’s very difficult to win. Of course, the fact you’ve run out first is a function of your luck and skill during play, but it’s still an unsatisfying end to proceedings.;For more, check out our round ups of the best board games for couples, the best cheap board games, and the best Star Wars board games.', 'This dilemma, that you can only gain power by sacrificing the potential for power later, is the fulcrum on which the game rests.

And the memories will stay long after the novelty has gone.', 'What Next stitches together bits and pieces of lots of different games from several different genres, and the result is both charming and unlike anything else on the market.', \"Most popular tabletop role-playing systems favor dice to determine whether or not the player’s actions succeed or fail. It was frustration with their arbitrary nature that lead the designer of What Next (see it on Amazon) to create this, his very first game. It's a cooperative family adventure in which success is determined by a variety of dexterity challenges instead of dice. (For more team adventures, check out our roundup of the best cooperative board games.);There are three adventures of increasing difficulty to choose from: a wilderness rescue, a superhero yarn and a sci-fi escape tale.;The box of What Next is noteworthy in itself. Rather than a slide-off lid, it has a gatefold opening with a magnetic clasp. There’s an archway cut into the outer flap with a cartoon mural beneath that introduces your adventure. These kinds of boxes are common for smaller games, but this is a full-sized box and the effect is charming, like you’re being welcomed into a favorite novel.;Within there’s such an eclectic set of components that you could be forgiven in thinking you’d bought a design kit rather than a game. There are three boxes of cards, one for each adventure, each holding three decks of different sizes for locations, events and items. A paper bag holds a variety of blue plastic shapes, another holds irregular purple blocks made of sturdy foam. A drawstring bag holds an even more irregular set of yellow plastic pieces.;In terms of cardboard, you have to assemble three dials, one for each adventure, to track time. There’s also a long cardboard wedge, marked into areas, which goes with a wooden puck piece. It’s an intriguing collection that’ll pique your curiosity to see them in play.;The basic structure of What Next? will be familiar to anyone that’s played an adventure gamebook. A player reads out the narrative text on the top card of the Location deck to set the scene. This will normally lead to being offered a choice which can be a mix of other Location cards to go to or Events to tackle. As a group, you’re expected to debate their relative merits and decide what to do.;In reality, there are few clues as to which is the best choice: part of the game is attempting the same adventure multiple times and learning the optimal paths. This isn’t a problem with the game as the adventures are quite short, and the real meat of play lies in undertaking challenges to overcome problems.;Challenges are detailed on the appropriate card but fall into one of four broad groups. In a shape build, you need to find the right blue pieces to fill in a shape on the card, a bit like a Tangrams puzzle. Searching for things involves dipping into the bag of yellow shapes and feeling around, blind, to locate one or more particular forms. The third is the puck push, where you flick the wooden disc up the wedge, aiming for a particular point.;It’s the fourth group that’s most noteworthy, however, since it involves whatever crazy mini-games the designer could come up with using the pieces in the box. These can range from you throwing cards at other players to trying to knock the bottom piece out of a stack with a quick flick on the puck.;As you might imagine, these challenges vary hugely in difficulty: that last one, for example, feels almost impossible. Sometimes you get practice tries which often serve only to strain the nerves before the actual attempt. Certain members of your group may be better at some challenges than others, which can feed into your strategy. What the challenges never are is dull.;Whoever reads the location card has to undertake the challenge, on rare occasions with a helper. Everyone else gets to watch with bated breath, shouting advice and encouragement. It’s a lovely little piece of gaming theatre, aided by that nagging sense that, even in the surest hands, failure is just around the corner.;When you do fail, the penalty is sometimes missing a useful item but more often it’s adding a piece to the Tower of Peril. This is what the purple foam shapes are for: your first two sit side by side and pieces thereafter have to be stacked on top. They’re all manner of weird shapes and there’s definite strategy space in learning how best to line them up. And it’s an important skill to learn because if one falls, it’s game over for the group.;While this makes peril-stacking deliciously tense, this single point of failure can be hard on clumsier players. That’s especially true if you’re playing What Next? as a family game with children, who might find the tower difficult and losing more difficult still. It depends on the individual child, of course, and it’s otherwise a very good family game.;Indeed it’s clearly written as a game for kids, with all three adventures adopting a tone of wry comedy, full of silly ideas and showpiece moments. But there’s plenty to enjoy for all ages, from nods to popular franchises to the occasional hidden gag for adults. It’s hard to imagine anyone feeling self-conscious reading out the text since everyone is in on the joke.;Despite the quality of the writing, there’s only so many times you can hear a quip before it gets stale. And repetition is the biggest danger you’ll face during your adventures in What Next. The game tries hard to alleviate this issue. Once every four turns you’ll flip a location card for a different, harder, text and challenge. And the mini-games themselves take a while to master. But some of the charm is lost when you start ignoring over-familiar narratives.;There’s also sometimes a weird sense of artificiality about play. While the mini-games are often a good mimic for the narrative - repairing a compass by making a circle out of shape fragments, for example - it can be hard to lose yourself in the world of What Next. That’s because the group taking on individual challenges is clearly an artifice to get everyone involved. It can be played as a solo game, which offers a more cohesive sense of narrative to make up for what you lose in group dynamics.;What Next retails for $50 and is available now.;For more, check out our picks for the best board games for 5 year olds, the best quick playing board games, and the best Star Wars board games.\", 'Part of the game is attempting the same adventure multiple times and learning the optimal paths;There’s plenty to enjoy for all ages, from nods to popular franchises to the occasional hidden gag for adults')\n",

Wonderland’s Alice, from Unmatched: Battle of Legends Volume One, for example, feels a bit like Dr. Jekyll since both have the ability to flip between aggressive and defensive stances.\\xa0\\n\\nBesides the ability to mix and match characters, another hallmark is the use of unique decks to give flavor and strategy to wildly different characters. And here, none of the sets do it so well as Unmatched: Cobble & Fog. With its iconic characters, each well realized with a distinct and thematic play style, it’s a fantastic place to start with the series, or to add to an existing collection.', 'Unmatched: Cobble & Fog introduces four beloved characters from classic Victorian literature into this game of strategic battles, illustrating their unique character traits using simple cards and abilities.', \"It’s an amusing irony that the genre-bending Unmatched series started life as the strict franchise tie-in Star Wars: Epic Duels. That had a great game engine but vanished when the license expired, only to be reborn as an anything-goes tactical battler that pitched two legendary characters from across cultures against each other.;Later boxes added characters from film, such as Jurassic Park, and TV such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And they’re all cross-compatible, so it’s quite possible to have Bruce Lee facing off against Bigfoot. Now classic Victorian literature has been added to the mix with the gothic stylings of Unmatched: Cobble & Fog (see it at Amazon), giving us one of the best horror board games out there.;Still need to scratch that Star Wars itch? We've got you covered with our roundup of the best Star Wars board games.;If you like big, pretty game boards when you open a box, Unmatched: Cobble & Fog will, like all its peers, offer an initial disappointment. The board is small, a series of interconnected circles printed over some drab background art. It’s double-sided, though, convenient and functional. It in no way prepares you for what’s underneath.;Because beyond that, the components are great. There are four miniatures for the characters in this set: Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Jekyll and The Invisible Man. They’re reasonable sculpts, improved by being good, hard plastic and coming already ink washed to bring out the detail and depth.;Each character also has a health dial and a deck of cards. The latter are great, from the stylized card back icons that tie into their character’s lore, to the clear text and stylized comic-style art on the front. Once it’s all set out on the table, the good stuff easily compensates for the dull board, making it quite an eye-catching spectacle.;One of the big draws of the Unmatched series is that it’s simple to get going. Both players choose a character. Then, they decide on which board to use -- one of them in this set has a novel secret passage mechanic -- set up the figures in prescribed spaces, draw five cards, and it’s game on. In theory the game also works with four, playing as two teams of two, but it’s at its best as a head to head, earning its way onto our list of the best board games for 2 players.;On your turn you take two actions, which can either be to draw a card and move, or to play an attack or scheme card. Melee characters can only attack adjacent spaces, whereas ranged ones can attack any spaces the same color as that in which the attacker is located. That is one of the reasons for the lackluster board game, and it's worth the trade off for the speed and clarity it brings to play.;If you’re attacked, you can play a defense card from your hand or not, as you choose, and you take the difference between the values in damage. That’s it. Last character standing wins. You now know how to play Unmatched. So: given the striking simplicity of the rules, how on earth does the series manage to leverage any kind of depth and variety?;The answer is in the cards. Each character has a unique deck and a special power. Some of them also have “sidekicks,” weaker fighters they can command alongside their main, such as Holmes’ dependable assistant Doctor Watson. The way each deck leverages those straightforward rules to give every character a unique play style is a thing of genius.;Let’s stick with Holmes for an example. His special ability is that his card effects can’t be cancelled or blocked, a nod to his fearsome powers of planning. Many of his cards let him look at his opponent’s hand, giving a sense that Holmes is always one step ahead. Others let you use that knowledge to try and predict the values of your opponent’s cards, which feels like the process of deduction Holmes is famous for.;Between them, the duo don’t have many attack cards, but the ones they field are powerful. Again, this represents the way the characters are written: Holmes as a reluctant but skilled pugilist and Watson, who has ranged attacks, grudgingly using his army weapons if necessary. Between them, the cards in the deck bring the characters to life on the board as you play, without flavor text and with a bare minimum of exceptions and special rules.;All the decks in Unmatched: Cobble & Fog work the same extraordinary magic. Dr. Jekyll can choose to flip into the terrifying Mr. Hyde or back at the start of each turn. Only Jekyll can play the best defensive cards and only Hyde the best offensive ones, but moving as Hyde costs health. Dracula must coordinate with his three unholy progeny, all of them relatively fragile but with attacks that heal as they injure their targets. He also has cards that can lure and manipulate enemy figures.;At first, it seems the four are not well balanced. The Invisible Man, in particular, feels underpowered. He has three fog tokens on the board between which he can flit at will but he lacks big attack and defense plays. With practice however, things even up. His game is one of setting up and executing ambushes, then vanishing into the darkness.;Indeed, all four decks reveal hidden depths over repeat plays. The basic rules alone offer some solid strategic hooks. Characters with sidekicks can try and box their enemies into undesirable board positions. With only two actions per turn, it’s hard to set up an attack without leaving yourself vulnerable to a counter. You’re also forced to strike a balance between drawing and playing cards while trying to keep a range of options in your hand.;When you add in the layers created by special powers and unique card decks, there are all sorts of strategic levers to work. It’s true that the game can be frustrating when you can’t quite draw the cards you need to move your game plan forward. But without that seed of randomness, the game would devolve into stale repetition instead of retaining some vibrancy over repeat plays.;That said, repetition remains the worst fault in Unmatched: Cobble & Fog. Again, like other games in the series, despite all the great work that’s gone into giving each character a distinct style, those simple mechanics can’t quite take all the weight. Individual matchups do begin to feel a little worn after several attempts. Fortunately, with four characters to choose from, you’ve got six distinct combinations to keep you going.;The MSRP for Unmatched: Cobble & Fog is $39.99, but you can often find it on sale at the retailers below.;For more, check out our picks for the best board games for couples, the best trivia board games, and the best quick-playing board games.\", 'They’re all cross-compatible so it’s quite possible to have Bruce Lee facing off against Bigfoot;Indeed, all four decks reveal hidden depths over repeat plays')\n",

For some players, that’s going to feel more like hard work than fun. For most, though, Pan Am's simple rules and satisfying strategy should make it soar.\", 'Pan Am takes concepts that may be difficult to wrap your head around and turns them into a simple, fun board game.', \"Air carrier Pan Am went bust in 1991, but its blue and white logo remains iconic enough to adorn t-shirts, bags and, now, a game box. With it, you and your fellow players can watch the meteoric rise and collapse of Pan Am while you try to run your own airlines in its wake (see it on Amazon).;You might think that charting the history of an airline wouldn’t make for a very interesting board game, but Pan Am pulls out all the stops to offer an engaging, exciting experience with broad appeal. For those who choose to look, it even offers a cautionary subtext about the lure of predatory capitalism.;From that classic logo on the box and downward, Pan Am is dedicated to re-creating the seventies on your tabletop, like many of the best classic board games. From the fonts to the rulebook to the miniature travel posters on the Destination cards, it’s all unified with a smart, minimalist aesthetic. Younger players might not recognize it but they can still appreciate the graphic design chops on display.;The board folds out into a world map, criss-crossed with airline routes. Each player color gets a fleet of soft plastic planes in four different sizes and there’s a tray to keep them in during play. Most of the cards are a little on the small side, but sturdy. It’s an impressive package given the box size and price point.;Pan Am contains a solitary, but difficult, concept: that of landing rights. Your aim is to buy planes and use them to secure those routes on the board, which then turn a profit. To claim a route you have to have a plane of the right size and landing rights in the city at each end. That means either building an airport, or owning or discarding one or more Destination cards, depending on the city and region of the card.;Once you’ve understood how to gain landing rights, learning the rest of the board game is a breeze. Most of the action happens in the engineer phase. On your turn, you take one of your stock of engineer pieces and place it on an action you’d like to undertake. That could be building an airport or an airplane, collecting either a destination or special power “Directive” card, or putting a plane down to claim a route.;Most of these actions are mini-auctions. Next to each destination, for example, there’s a track from zero to six in increments of two. Where you place your engineer indicates how much you’re willing to pay to take the action. If you’re outbidding someone, they get their engineer back to place elsewhere on their next turn: maybe to outbid you, in turn.;From the start this offers a fantastic fusion of strategy and player interaction. Go in too low and you’ll get outbid. Go in too high and you risk going bankrupt or leaving yourself short in the bids for other actions this turn. And as well as running after your own objectives, you can make spoiling bids to annoy other players, forcing them to spend more to achieve their aims. It’s a fantastic boiler pot of tension that never stops simmering until the last turn.;At the same time, it’s never so unforgiving as to put players out of contention. There are four destination cards on offer each turn which have the potential to be secured with a bid of zero, so you’ll always get something. There’s only one track for airports, though, and each of the four airplane types, and bids cost more. Competition here can be deliciously intense, but there are always crumbs somewhere for the losers to hoover up.;Once all the bids are settled and the actions taken, you can claim income, one per airport and per length of route you own. Your new wealth can be split between saving for next turn’s bids or buying Pan Am stock: it’s having the most of these stocks that wins you the game. The stock purchase price fluctuates according to that turn’s event card. As well as a historic event, such as the Great Depression, which costs each player some income, it sets or changes the stock price. Shrewd gambles on whether it’ll go up or down thus become part of the strategy.;But there’s another route to profit which is the game’s crowning glory: being bought out by Pan Am itself. The event card also shows how many times to roll a custom six-sided dice that shows how many and which routes Pan Am expands along. All expansion starts from its Miami base and creeps around the globe as the game goes on. Routes they take are closed to player purchase. But if they expand onto one you already own, you lose the ongoing profit but get a handsome payoff instead.;Routes of potential interest to Pan Am are marked on the board, so it's up to you whether to go for route income, fish for a buyout or mix the two.

As a miniatures game, this is as much about how it looks as how it plays. Two painted armies of these superb miniatures clashing on the table is an awesome sight, and the game rules try to reflect that in play.\\xa0\\n\\nHence, they encourage a game full of big, cinematic moments. The brave hero, barreling into the foe and scattering them like ninepins. The huge beast, smashing through the ramparts, followed by a horde of cheering warriors. A wizard, calling down a lightning storm to deluge the enemy army with bolts of energy. Dice may battle with strategy for supremacy in Age of Sigmar and it’s sometimes frustrating, but the huge swings are all part and parcel of creating memorable tabletop moments to cherish.', 'Age of Sigmar: Dominion offers big, sweeping tabletop action to go with its great-looking models.', 'Age of Sigmar has a checkered history. First released as a simplified alternative to Games Workshop’s flagship miniatures game Warhammer Fantasy Battle, it left fans infuriated by the sudden scrapping of that entire line. The second edition was a big improvement, refining and solidifying an overly simplistic concept into a fast, fun but more competitive game.;Dominion is the introductory box for the new third edition (see it on Amazon). While the core rules are free and you can buy whatever figures you want for your army, these starter boxes represent a great value for your money. Third edition promises to be backwards compatible with existing forces from the previous edition, so let’s take a look at what’s changed.;Waiting to greet you when you open Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Dominion is a bright mural of battle. Beneath it is sprue after sprue of plastic waiting to be clipped out, trimmed and glued together. When you’re done, you’ll have 58 of the finest plastic miniatures imaginable, enough to make two starter armies.;The Stormcast Eternals are divine warriors, encased in massive suits of armor. Older Stormcast models have been detailed but a little on the static side. These are big step up, featuring much bolder and more fluid poses. Their leader, Yndrasta, framed by her angelic wings and mounted atop a stone staircase, is magnificent.;Against them are the wicked Kruelboyz, a new faction in what Games Workshop calls “Orruks”. If anything, these are even better than the Stormcast. Their snarling, sinister shapes are a throwback to the old-school orcs of more traditional fantasy. But they’re still bristling with the detail and movement we’ve come to expect. Their companion hobgrotz are the only weak item in the box, odd-looking little goblinoids with weird proportions.;Beneath the figures is a huge hardback rulebook. This looks very daunting until you realize that the vast majority of it is a mixture of lore, art, and stunning photos of painted figures. The core rules of play are about 40 pages, punctuated with sidebars and diagrams and examples. There are more pages of rules on how to pick armies and set up battles, but they can be ignored for your first few games.;It’s important to note that building and painting these kinds of models is a time-consuming task. This isn’t a box you can just break open and play. But that’s to be expected since Age of Sigmar is more of a hobby unto itself than a board game to add to your collection.;If you’ve played a miniatures wargame before, particularly a Games Workshop one, you’ll find Age of Sigmar: Dominion follows a familiar rhythm. You dice off to see who goes first each turn. Units then move, measured on the table with a tape measure. They can run for extra distance or retreat to leave combat but doing so disallows them from an extra charge move to get into melee.;Units with missile weapons can then fire, and units in melee can then attack, with players taking alternating activations to decide what order fights get resolved in. You roll dice to see if models hit, to see if they cause a wound and then to see if their armor protects them, all against single numbers printed on the units’ \"warscroll\" alongside its special abilities.;Basically, you roll a lot of dice, and they often rule the day. There’s an even more critical roll following combat where you add the number of slain models to the dice to see if the unit takes additional casualties from fleeing. It’s a similar story for magic, which involves rolling dice to cast spells and more dice if your opponent tries to counter. Spells are powerful so these can be critical, although the limited number of counter chances means you have to choose your moments with care.;And this is where Age of Sigmar begins to become more than just a lot of random roll-offs to see who wins. There’s a broad sense of rock, paper, scissors about the units in the game, where particular types do better against some enemies than others. You don’t really want your elite Stormcast Annihilators stuck in a grinding fight against Orruk Gutrippaz, for example. Especially not when the latter have poison weapons that can bypass their sturdy armour.;So, movement and positioning become crucial. All the more so because leader figures can spend from a pool of command points each turn to buy cool abilities like resurrecting dead models or buffing units in attack and defense. But these can only be used on figures within a certain range of the leader. Good use of these commands is important for victory.;Leaders and heroes are powerhouses compared to rank-and-file units, sometimes to an almost ridiculous degree. The Stormcast leader, Yndestra, costs almost twice as much to add to your army as any of the other Stormcast units in the box. And with good reason: in addition to her flurry of ranged and melee attacks, she has a raft of special abilities. Nearby friendly units, for example, not only don’t flee but can re-add slain models.;Again, positioning and timing is critical if you want to make best use of these powers. The Kruelboyz equivalent leader is mounted on a huge monster, and monsters have gotten a big boost in this edition. Now they have access to abilities like smashing terrain or terrifying enemy units into inactivity with a furious roar.;However cool the \"Great Gnashtoof\" is to play with, it can’t hold a candle to Yndestra. Indeed, more broadly, the Kruelboyz in the box struggle to keep up with their Stormcast opponents. And when you break it down, it’s not hard to see why: in the game\\'s points system used to ensure two forces are roughly balanced, the included Stormcast models are worth almost a third more than the Orruks.;As a result, battles fought solely with the Dominion box contents will favor the Stormcast unless you take some of the models out. This might seem odd until you remember that this isn’t supposed to be a stand-alone game. It’s an introductory set for the wider Age of Sigmar universe. Based on these foundations, it’ll be fascinating to see how Games Workshop redevelops other existing factions with these new rules.;Want more like this?

Nevertheless, it looks great on the table, has an unusual theme and has a wide range of variants suitable for different ages and play styles, all of which make it adaptable to a smorgasbord of tastes and situations. A lot of its peers try to make their mark by adding additional layers of complexity which sometimes obscure the raw fun of stacking things in big, wobbly piles, and if it’s that elemental joy that you’re after, Nekojima delivers it handsomely.', 'If you want a stacking game that retains the simple, accessible delights of piling things on top of each other, but want it to look better and play more peculiarly than Jenga, look no further.', 'Nekokima is a Japanese term that translates as “cat island”, which is potentially something of a problem if you’re trying to wire up an electricity network in the area. That’s the premise for this curious and spectacular-looking dexterity board game from the wonderfully named Unfriendly Games in which you’ve not only got to stack up a crisscross of wires without them touching, but deal with an infestation of frisky felines who want to hang from the cat’s cradle you’ve inadvertently created.;Dexterity games often come packed with all sorts of unexpected objects, and Nekojima is no exception. The bulk of the box space is filled up with thick wooden dowels of various lengths, paired together with stiff bits of cord, from one of three different potential colors. Each color has two or three possible pairings of different-length dowels. They’re meant to represent pylons, with the cords as power cables.;The remainder of the contents are circumspect in comparison. There’s a thick, circular plastic board, divided into four quadrants, and a sheet of counters which include some sinuous, chunky cardboard cats. There are also two custom wooden dice and a collection of wooden cubes in the same three colors as the cords plus black, to match the cats. The cubes go into a supplied linen draw bag.;It’s not the most attractive game at first glance – the only art is on the board and it, alongside the dice icons, are more about function than form. But, as is often the case, the visual kicks in Nekokima come from what you do with the components rather than the pieces themselves.;Again, like many of the best dexterity games, this is a pretty simple affair. On your turn you’ll roll the two dice which will indicate two quadrants of the board. Sometimes you might get to choose, sometimes an opponent will get to pick instead. You then draw a cube from the bag, pick a pair of dowels - they’re called Denchuu, which is Japanese for “power pole” – and you place one dowel in one of the specified board quadrants, and the other in the other. Occasionally, both poles need to go in the same quadrant. Simple!;Except of course, it isn’t. The poles have a specific orientation with the cords at the top and, once placed, the cords are not allowed to touch any poles, or any other cords, nor to hang over the board edge. The first couple of placements are very straightforward, but very soon a web of cords will be threading across the board, necessitating much more imaginative and nimble placements. To make matters worse, you’re not allowed to tweak the cord position with your fingers: you can only adjust it by manipulating the two poles themselves. The cord is stiff, but still has a tendency to misbehave just when you think you’ve wrangled it into position.;If you finish placing the poles and the cords break this rule, you have to extract them and try again, which a sweaty-palmed ordeal in and of itself. But even when you succeed, your job may not be done. If you were unlucky enough to draw any black cubes on your turn, you have to keep drawing until you get a color, and then hang black cats on matching cords without, again, the cats or cords touching each other, the poles or the ground. There are a selection of such death-defying feline shapes, some of which are much easier to hang than others.;Naturally, the ground space on the board fills up very quickly, and players must then start to stack the poles atop one another. This is where the different heights of the poles on each denchuu become interesting, as, with a bit of thought, they allow you to make both easier and more interesting placements. You have no way of knowing what your opponents are going to roll, but you can certainly try to cramp their style by throwing a cord across an open area. This opens up all sorts of interesting risk versus reward decisions as regards how hard you want to make life for yourself in the quest to make life harder for your opponents, which all contributes toward forcing the tower higher.;As it turns out, the poles are thick enough to stack with a fairly high degree of stability, which is kind of both a blessing and a curse. The problem is that it can make the early game feel too easy as you pile poles atop each other and up into the stratosphere. The upsides are that it both makes the game look spectacular on the table as your man-made forest ascends to head-height, festooned with cats and bright-colored wires, and that it ensures an exciting endgame as the foundations finally begin to wobble. Hanging cats also has the potential to cause instant chaos, even on a relatively low tower.;If piling the poles competitively isn’t your thing, the game plays well both cooperatively and solitaire with a very simple rules change. Drawn cubes all slot into a level board that runs up to level seven, with four cubes per level. Your challenge, either solo or working in a group, is simply to beat the highest level you can. The interesting thing about playing this way is that it reverses the calculations needed to rope off areas and block them from other players: rather, you want to stack and twist in places that will make it easier to follow on. There are also a number of variants included to try, extending the game’s replay value by doing things like limiting the stack height, or playing in pairs with each player taking one of a denchuu.;For more, check out our picks for the best RPG board games, as well as the best board games for adults to play now.', None)\n",

Fortunately, it plays well solo, which seems to be the way many of its devotees seem to enjoy it.

And, in many ways, it’s a shame there aren’t more games like this, and fewer games overall.', \"Imperium: Horizons is a deep, complex game, so it's not for everyone. But if you think you can spare the significant effort required, it's very much worth your attention.\", \"Thanks partly to the influence of Sid Meier’s series of Civilization video games, the genre brings to mind vast maps, exploration and inter-empire conflict, whether that’s on the screen or the table with board games. But back in 2006, a card game called Through the Ages changed all that by giving players civilization-building in all its glory without a map. As bizarre as this sounds, it was brilliant, and paved the way for other card-only conquest titles. Arguably the most successful of these was the Imperium series, which used very novel mechanics to bring to life the developmental arc of civilizations. Now it’s back in the form of Imperium: Horizons, a new, tidier, edition with all-new strategic concepts and all-new civilizations to play.;Imperium: Horizons is a heavy box, and it’s a heavy box because it’s full of cards. There’s almost nothing else in there except for a few card punchboards and a handy divider that separates the very many card decks in the game, plus a slotted lid where you can store the punched tokens. Each division is helpfully labeled with the deck that’s supposed to go there.;The cards themselves are decent quality, and the art is distinctive and colorful, full of detail but with a charming rough edge, like a comic strip. The style fits in perfectly with the previous two Imperium games, Classics and Legends. There’s a unique deck for each of the 14 civilizations included in the game, plus several decks of common cards, and a set of replacement cards for the older games in the series that tweak some of the effects.;While the inclusion of a rulebook should be obvious, it’s worth nothing that this is a revised and expanded ruleset over the older editions, with some new play concepts and extended examples to make things clear.;One of the biggest differentiations between Imperium and other civilization games is that each player gets their own historical civilization to play, with a unique starter deck. These are often wildly different from each other, and sometimes come with their own rules. Some, like the Utopians and the Inuit, get minor tweaks like different numbers of starting resources or exhaust tokens. Others, like the Martians and the Cultists, are radically different, lacking entire parts of the decks other civilizations have, replacing them with new concepts like the Martian gadgets or the double-sided Cultist ceremony cards. Even for those like that Magyars that stay wholly within the rules as written, every deck requires its own approach to play.;It’s also a deck-building game. Most nations start off in a barbaric state, with a small draw deck and a number of Nation cards. As the game goes on, you’ll add and remove cards from your draw deck, fine-tuning your strategy as you go. Sometimes, you’ll buy common cards from a market. Also, most civilizations have a deck of Nation cards, a random one of which gets added to your play deck on each reshuffle. Once all these have been depleted, your civilization flips from a barbaric to a imperial state and can start adding its Development cards from a separate pile: these must be paid for with resources rather than added for free. Being civilized or barbaric impacts which cards you can pick up from the market, and also the effects of other cards that you play.;Acquiring new cards from the market usually also means picking up unrest cards. These clog up your hand and, if the unrest deck runs out, will end the game early in a collapse. Then the player with the fewest unrest cards will win. Otherwise, your goal is to accumulate points, which will come from diverse sources, depending on your civilization. Many cards are worth points at the game end, often chaining in with other game aspects. Mostly you’ll be taking action turns which involve you playing cards to build up your civilization or, sometimes, attacking other players -- but you can also take revolt turns to rid yourself of unrest or innovate turns which let you gain new cards without taking unrest.;By this point, it’s hopefully clear that Imperium: Horizons is a pretty complex and unusual game, with so many cards and civilizations that break its core rules that trying to explain them all would be a waste of effort and makes it hard to recomend for younger players (if that's what you're looking for, see our roundup of the best board games for kids). This is both the game’s greatest strength and its greatest weakness. The core game flow is hard to grasp and, even then, you’ll have a fresh learning curve to climb with each new civilization you try to play. While you can get a feel for how to approach it from your opening hand, there’s a lot of nuance in the strategy, and you’ll probably need multiple games to master each faction. This is a colossal ask in terms of play time. To make things worse, all the cards must be separated back into their individual decks at the end of each game, making setup and teardown time-consuming.;Your reward for putting in the effort is a game of astonishing variety and grace. Its core loop is innovative, but the deck-building is actually a lovely stand-in for the slow pace of social development. Each run through your deck adds a new card, representing a new technology, the rise to power of an important leader, some additional lands you’ve discovered and so forth. The flip from barbarism to civilization suddenly unlocks huge new card acquisition, effect combos, and point-scoring opportunities. Yet no two of the game’s civilizations go about doing these things in the same way, and different match-ups will thus spawn even more variation. The market of common cards will also be different each time, ensuring you always have to stay on your toes in terms of strategy.;This level of flexibility allows you, to some extent, to tailor the game to your own taste. Attack cards and the new trade routes rules give a significant level of player interaction to the game. You’ll need to build up to your attacks carefully, timing them well to maximise their impact. Because you’ll also see when other players are adding attack cards to their deck, you must also try to defend your own position. But if you don’t want this kind of aggressive play, you can choose to play using only peaceful nations, such as the Japanese or the exploration-focused Polynesians. There’s even a low-aggression variant for a bit of both worlds, as well as a solo board game option.;Whichever way you play, it’s all about feeling your way through the strategies available to you, playing to your nation’s strengths which keeping a close eye on what everyone else is doing. There are a plethora of combo opportunities available across the breadth of rules. Sometimes you’ll be looking to execute one direct from your hand, and at others you’ll be putting a multi-turn plan into motion to try and pull off a particularly powerful play. So it scratches both tactical and strategy board game itches, while the low randomness and potential for interaction ensures it’s both deep but also thrilling.;For more, check out our roundups of the best quick-playing board games, the best alternatives to Warhammer, and the best roll-and-write board games.\", 'Imperium: Horizons is a heavy box, and it’s a heavy box because it’s full of cards')\n",

Its innovations, such as leader cards, are a double-edged sword, forcing players into a race for big swing turns. Beyond that, however, the core game is solid, with plenty of opportunities to look at deck building strategy and in-game tactics, although this starter set doesn’t entirely showcase it to the best of its ability. It’ll be exciting to see what the designers and players can do with Unlimited as it expands.', 'Star Wars Unlimited delivers a solid core game, with plenty of opportunities to look at deck building strategy and in-game tactics.', \"A short time ago, in game shops that were pretty close to home, you could indulge in a clever collectible card game called Star Wars Destiny. It had a lot going for it, including a novel, fast-paced turn structure and the addition of custom dice that were put into play by matching cards. Those dice, however, were expensive to produce, and after three iterations of releases, Star Wars Destiny was banished to the Dark Side. Just like a Sith lord, however, it wouldn't stay buried for long, and now many of its best ideas, minus the dice, are back in the form of Star Wars Unlimited.;Like most modern collectible card games, your introduction to Star Wars Unlimited is likely to be in the form of a starter box. We’ll be reviewing one such set, called Spark of Rebellion, in this overview. It comes with two decks of cards, one led by Luke Skywalker and the other by Dark Vader, each with a basic deck box to keep them organized. Also included are also two paper play mats to organize your cards and some incredibly flimsy counters to track damage and other game elements.;If you decide to expand your collection, it’ll come in the form of booster packs of random cards (see on Amazon). As you might imagine, you can also upgrade those bare-bones accessories to acrylic tokens, sturdy branded deck boxes, and neoprene play mats if you so desire. There are also matching crates and card sleeves available to keep things neat and organized.;The cartoon-style card art is likely to be divisive. There’s a distinctive style used across the range, riffing on familiar comic strips and animated shows based on the iconic films. But folk who want to focus on the movies might find it a little simplistic and child-like. While illustrations of well-known figures from the franchise are detailed and characterful, the style doesn’t work as well for vehicles, which look a little too minimalist to my eye.;The biggest thing that Star Wars Unlimited borrows from Star Wars Destiny is its fast-paced structure of discrete actions. In many other collectible card games, a player takes a series of actions during their turn before handing over to the other player. But here players take turns undertaking small actions like playing a card, attacking with a character, or using a card ability, before passing it back to their opponent. This makes it feel much more dynamic, and introduces elements of timing as part of the overall strategy.;Your goal is to destroy your opponent’s base, which has 30 health points. Either side of your base becomes a theater for ground or space units, as indicated on their card. Once played, units can attack targets in the equivalent theater or the base, it’s the controller’s choice, although cards with the “sentinel” keyword have to be attacked first. Attackers deal and take damage according to the stats on their cards, and if they take more damage than they have hitpoints, they’re destroyed.;It’s easy to assume that this structure would reward all-out attacks on the enemy base, and you can certainly play the game this way. Indeed, the Imperial deck in the Spark of Rebellion starter set can work with this approach, featuring lots of high-attack, low-hitpoint units. But the game rewards better timing and nuance than such a gung-ho approach. If you’re not careful, it can lead to your opponent attacking your units in favorable trade-offs that kill yours while leaving theirs alive, which will then be free to assault your base on later turns. The split between ground and space feeds into this, as you’ll need to muster units in both in order to defend effectively.;Card play is not free. Rather, you draw two cards per turn, and you’re allowed to place one card face-down as a resource. Resources can be exhausted to pay for cards. In theory this should make for some tough choices as you decide which, if any, of your precious cards you’ll be permanently sacrificing to power your resource pool, and there are times it works like this. But in practice, the need to keep increasing your pool each turn trumps any notion of keeping things back for later use. This, in turn, makes it very tempting to sacrifice powerful cards you’re several turns away from playing as resources, meaning a lot of the game action is undertaken by grunt units.;One of the reasons there’s such a driver to get your resources out at a steady pace is the notion of leader cards. Each deck has one: the starter decks in Spark of Rebellion feature Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Leaders sit on the battlefield from the start of the game and have an ongoing ability or action available to help your cause, but once you reach a certain resource threshold they enter play as extremely powerful characters you can attack with. If they’re defeated, they go back to their ongoing ability, but can never again take an active role in the fight.;Leaders are, by their nature, extremely swingy. They have a huge impact when they enter play, which is why you can’t slack up on the resource race and keep your cards. Darth Vader, for example, has 5 attack -- 8 if he’s upgraded with his lightsaber, a separate card - and can deal an additional 2 damage to any unit. That’s a whole third of the base life total needed to win the game in a single attack. This sudden rush of offensive power can often win the game in a manner that feels random and unsatisfying. Adding to the problem, many cards in these starter decks, including said lightsaber, tie in with the leader is some way, which makes for fun combos but increases that sense of swinginess.;Outside of leader tilt, other aspects of card play and interaction are much more engaging. Card keywords, such as the aforementioned sentinel and its opposite, saboteur, which allows units to both ignore sentinel and punch through protective shields on the defender, are a big part of this, forcing you to time plays and choose targets carefully. Other cards have combo effects, like providing instant attacks, card draws or buffing friendly units. You must take care to split your ground and space forces so you’re not undefended in either theater. Upgrades are a particular pleasure: the ones included in this set, like Luke’s lightsabre, get bonuses if they’re given to the appropriate character, but it’s also fun to see some grunt rebel trooper swinging it about instead.;As fun as chaining up card combos is, with just two cards draws per turn, one of which you’ll usually want to put into resources, there’s sometimes a sense of card starvation. This is particularly acute when games turn into tit-for-tat unit tradeoffs, leaving neither side with much to take on the offense. That may, in part, be a fault of the starter decks included, which seem to have been created to deliberately play off each other’s strength and weaknesses. But it does hint at much richer deck-building possibilities to come once the card pool expands, especially if card draw effects are included. It also, counter-intuitively, increases the tension and excitement in the game as you wait to see if you can pull off a combo that’ll suddenly break the cycle and give you the edge in the arms race.\", None)\n",

There are a variety of clean-cut wooden pieces, two pawns in each of four player colors, an expedition leader pawn and some mountains that highlight barriers on the board. A pad of note sheets is also included, and each player has a screen to hide their notes and a set of cardboard tokens behind. Finally, there are two small decks of cards and some timing tokens alongside a slightly bizarre but amusing boat-shaped tray to build and hold them in.;As a game with an ecological theme, The Search for Lost Species takes its green credentials seriously. There’s an information sheet included explaining how most of the materials were sourced in an environmentally-friendly way. The six lost species you can hunt for are all real animals, and all on the brink of extinction, none having been seen for several decades. The paragraphs about them at the end of the rulebook make for sobering reading.;The Search for Lost Species uses a time mechanism to determine turn order. Different actions you can take demand that you move your pawn forward on the time track different numbers of spaces. Whoever is furthest behind gets to take their turn, until their pawn overtakes another on the time track, and so on. So you’re always caught on the horns of choosing less impactful, faster actions against slower, more useful ones in terms of where others are on the time track.;Your two most common options will be to search the island, either by boat or by foot. In both cases, you choose a range of hexes and either look for empty hexes or select one of the four animal types. You put this into the app, and it’ll tell you how many of that particular animal there were in the hexes you searched. Going by boat is faster, but it’s restricted to coastal hexes and has a minimum search range of four, meaning the information you get is less useful. Knowing there’s one toad somewhere among those four isn’t terribly helpful. As a result, tapping your locations in and seeing the results has a fun frisson of excitement as you’re on tenterhooks to find out if you’ve pinned down some helpful information.;However, from the outset you’re given extra information to narrow down the location of each animal. There’s only one species per hex, and the app starts you off with a few titbits on which animals are absent from some hexes. You can configure this to give more starting clues to particular players, which is a fantastic way to give a leg-up to younger or less experienced participants and making it a good board game for kids. Each animal also has some fixed rules about where it lives. The four Lories - a kind of parrot - for example, always live next to each other in a fixed diamond pattern. So once you’ve found two, you can narrow down the other two are very easily.;As well as varying the location of species for each game, the app also offers additional rules about animal locations that vary between games. You can access these via the fastest action, visiting a town. This requires you to spend a town token, of which you only have one, and lets you take a card from a face up selection and do some research. The cards either improve one of the game’s actions or offer bonus points for certain conditions, while the research gives you an extra clue for whatever species you choose. So in every game you know that each of the two toads is adjacent to two empty spaces, but in your particular game you might learn that exactly one of the toads lives in the hills.;Using this drip feed of information, you can make educated guesses about what species lives in which hex. There are a lot of these clues, and piecing them together is fun and challenging. But it’s also weirdly stressful because one mistake can be disastrous. Getting one animal in the wrong hex means you’re going to make errors in following other clues, and misidentify further species, a chain reaction of chaos. But then again, making intuitive stabs based on good odds can pay dividends. The order in which you choose to pick up research or search for species can have a big impact on how your game unfolds. It’s up to you how you piece your game plan together and how much you want to rely on educated guesses.;Every so often, all the player pawns will the expedition leader pawn on the time track. When this happens, one of several things can occur. Most often, players get to place sighting tokens, which indicate hexes where they think particular animals live. You’re allowed to check whether your sightings were correct several turns later, which is both a big source of points and of clues as to the makeup of the island. Before they’re revealed, you can use sightings to guess about what’s on the island: if they put down a token for a python in a hex you know they’ve explored for pythons, there’s a good bet that’s where the python is. They might have made a mistake, though, or even be bluffing. The latter is a high-risk tactic, however, as incorrect sightings not only lose out on the points but are punished on the time track.;Moving the leader can also result in players regaining their town tokens so they can make another visit, or also their camera trap tokens, an additional action that allows you to pinpoint the animal that lives in a particular hex. Finally, on two occasions, the leader will result in all the players getting the same research information about the lost species. This animal, of which there are numerous possible options to keep things varied, has its own placement rules like other species. But it’s so elusive that you can’t ever find it by exploration: its hex will appear to be empty. All you have to go on is elimination, from identifying other habitats, and the various rules that you’re given through research.;Guessing the location of the lost species is the game’s final, and longest, action. If you’re right, you’ll get a huge points bonus and trigger the end game. Other players can still win if they’re close to making the deduction themselves, and they have better sightings than you, but getting their first is a big boost. As a result, once the pieces begin to fall into place, this very cerebral, puzzly game acquires an extraordinary amount of tension and made our list of the best board games for couples. You’re always nervous that your neighbor is just about to declare that big search action and pinpoint the lost species, and there’s a mounting temptation to risk those intuitive leaps and see if you can get in there first. But it’s almost certainly game over if you get it wrong.;For more, check out our picks for the best trivia board games, the best cheap board games, and the best 3-player board games.', 'There are a lot of these clues, and piecing them together is fun and challenging')\n",

The need to keep the core rules intact limits what the game can do with its cooperative elements so, while it’s fun to work together, there are much better cooperative games around if that’s your bag. That is, however, a bit unfair on this box because it also works as a standard Unmatched game and, in that respect, it’s an excellent choice with varied character options and a lovely board. It’s best seen that way and if, after a few taut head-to-head fights, you fancy something different, playing cooperatively offers an interesting change of pace.', 'Unmatched: Tales to Amaze offers a fresh take on the Unmatched franchise, but there are better cooperative games out there.', 'As a series, Unmatched is pretty much unmatched. Its central conceit -- duels between two fictional characters from across fantasy and sci-fi, myth and movies -- sounds shaky. But in practice, its simple yet exciting and tactical systems have led to great release after great release. Where else can you enjoy a truly compelling showdown between Beowulf and Deadpool? This latest box in the series, Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze is, however, a major departure mechanically because it can be played as a cooperative board game as well as head-to-head. The question is whether it’ll also be a departure in terms of quality.;Most Unmatched boxes are small, understated affairs and belie the cool miniatures -- and the fun -- within. Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze is a bigger, showier thing that arrives in the kind of square box that’s typical of modern board games. The cover art, full of color and detail, is also a step up from the usual limited palette, cartoon-style art that has characterized the series so far.;Fans of the existing style won’t be disappointed, however, once they dig into the contents. While the rulebook is also full of color, the various card decks used in the game continue with the traditional cartoon art. The four heroes included are also represented with miniatures of the same high quality as previous releases, with the same ink wash to make them pop. There are two new figures for the adversaries, Mothman and the Martian Invader, which are just glorious. They’re bigger than the hero figures and full of detail, from Mothman’s feathery wings to the Martian’s flying stand and neon green cockpit.;Both the heroes and the foes have sidekicks, who are featured on the board with hard plastic discs. The same style is used in a slew of on-board markers that are unique to this edition. Speaking of which, the two-sided board has had a very welcome upgrade. They’re still point-to-point maps, with colors in the circles to indicate different board areas, but the background art is far more lavish and fun to play on than the bare-bones doodles that have characteried previous boards in the series.;A few sheets of punch-out cardboard chits round out the contents, including health dials for the heroes and their sidekicks. There are also dials for the two villains, both with two digit circles to allow for higher health totals, both co-opted into fun visual styles that tie in to the monster they represent. It’s a nice box of toys, especially given the price point.;One of the secrets to Unmatched’s success is its straightforward rules, which makes it a good option for a family board game. On your turn, you can take two actions and there are three choices. First, you can pick up a card for your hand from the unique deck that ties in with your hero, and move your hero and any sidekicks they have. Second, you can play an attack card from your hand face-down to initiate an attack. The target can choose a face-down card to defend, then you compare the values on the cards and the target takes damage equal to the difference. Third, you can play a scheme card from your hand.;There’s a bit more detail around ranged attacks and legal moves but, on the whole, that’s your lot. The fun in the game comes from two sources. First, there’s a constant tension between the need to spend cards in attack and defense and the need to move in order to pick up more, which makes it very easy to overextend yourself in attack and leave yourself open to a punishing counter. Second, those unique decks give every hero an astonishing amount of individual character and a distinct play style, especially given the accessible rules framework.;Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze adds four new heroes to the ever-growing roster of the series. A sci-fi version of inventor Nikolai Tesla has no sidekick but bears two electrical coils which he can discharge to boost his card effects. If he ends a turn with both charged, he can deal damage to adjacent enemies. His is an aggressive game, which revolves around trying to balance that free effect with spending charges on cards.;Comic book character Jill Trent, Science Sleuth, has a choice of two gizmos to activate, which tie into her cards. She and her sidekick Daisy are flexible characters, able to fulfil different in-game roles. Folk legend riverboat captain Annie Christmas and her sidekick Charlie have a gambling-themed deck that encourages risk-taking. Finally, the Golden Bat, a Japanese superhero from 1930, hits hard so long as he doesn’t move, and his deck is built around maximizing this effect.;They’re a good line-up with lots of varied effects and, best of all, none of them feel entirely like any of the existing characters. So if you own other Unmatched sets, you can have fun integrating them into your battles, and you can also play a standard head-to-head fight on the boards provided. Otherwise, you’ll be pitting them against the Mothman or the Martian Invader in a cooperative game. Each boss uses its own side of the board, which reflects its overall game plan. Mothman is trying to destroy bridges between spaces, while the Invader is seeding fields with its alien progeny. They play quite differently, with the Invader being the tougher of the two.;Just like the heroes have sidekicks, your foe will also have a mix of minions, one per player. There’s a varied mix of these, drawn from popular legend and, like heroes, each has its own particular play style. The Loveland Frog gets to act more and more frequently as the game progresses, for example, while the Jersey Devil saps your hero’s cards. The options give you plenty of combinations to experiment with, but as a general rule, each presents an ever-escalating threat that you must divert resources to deal with. So they can feel a little same-y.;In a cooperative game, turn order is decided by drawing an initiative deck, so you can never be sure if one of the heroes, or one of the bad guys, will strike next. When your enemies act, they all follow the same simple AI script which sees them moving toward a hero and attacking them, based on a card draw from that villain’s deck. When a hero acts, it’s the same framework and the same dilemmas as you use in the competitive game, as you seek to attack enemies and grind down their health. And, like the competitive strategy game, it provides an ever-winding coil of tension as decks, health counters, and evil plots near their termini.;And, odd as it may seem, these similarities with the standard game are the chief problem with playing Unmatched cooperatively: it feels too much like a head-to-head game. The system does a good job of making your enemies feel dynamic and exciting to play against, but the rules just don’t support the kind of emergent cooperation and planning that you see in more dedicated cooperative titles. Each hero’s deck is designed to fight against opposing antagonists, not to work together. There are very few opportunities for stacking up card effects into combos between characters, or to use each other’s moves to achieve things you can’t in the standard game.;For more, check out our roundups of the best board games for kids, the best deck-building board games, and the best board games for 5-year olds.', 'Those unique decks give every hero an astonishing amount of individual character and a distinct play style;The rules just don’t support the kind of emergent cooperation you see in more dedicated cooperative titles')\n",

If you’re going to play a spooky game for Halloween, popular monster movies simply have a better cultural cachet than Greek antiquities. And that’s a shame, because taken as a stand-alone title, Horrified: Greek Monsters is very enjoyable, full of tough choices and thrilling moments. If you’re someone who’d rather vanquish Cerberus than the Creature from the Black Lagoon, then this is a great entry point to a great series of games.', 'Horrified: Greek Monsters is enjoyable, full of tough choices and thrilling moments.', \"Back in 2019 the original Horrified gave families a frightfully good time at Halloween as well as putting design house Prospero Hall on the collective family board gaming map. Its recipe of players cooperating to send various monsters from classic Universal movies back to their graves was enough of a hit to spawn a sequel, Horrified: American Monsters. Now it’s back for a third scary season running, with a move to the ancient world with Horrified: Greek Monsters (see it at Target).;Like all Prospero Hall games, Horrified: Greek Monsters has a quote printed on the back of the board to greet players when they first open the box. It’s a lovely touch that hasn’t been spoiled through familiarity. For this game, it’s more a scene-setting exercise, explaining that you’ve been chosen by the gods to rid the world of mythological monsters.;Beneath the fold-out board are the rest of the components. These consist of several punch-out sprues of cardboard tokens and character sheets, tracking sheets, and plastic figures for each of the game’s six monsters in various lurid colors, some nice dice in marbled blue, plastic stands for the cardboard standee figures and two decks of cards. There’s also a bag to store and draw the item chips from which, in contrast to the usual drawstring pouch supplied for this purpose, is a much more utilitarian self-standing affair.;Art-wise, these are solid, with an interesting style that mixes the classical art of the game’s theme with a comic-book vibe that’s common to the whole series. It doesn’t always work: the Hoplite character in particular looks bizarre, an armored punk rocker with a mohawk in place of a crested helmet. And in terms of quality, the card decks and monster sheets are a real disappointment. They’re very thin and flimsy to the point of being hard to handle, and they won’t stand up to repeat plays without some plastic protection, although that is in line with previous entries in the series.;Horrified: Greek Monsters retains the core of its predecessor and will be instantly familiar to anyone who's played the original Horrified. Players must work together, spending actions to move across the board and collect items, in the hope of defeating monsters released from Pandora’s Box. Items can be spent either to protect yourself from monster attacks or to work toward banishing a monster from the board. One new addition in this version is the concept of lairs, four tokens you place face-down on the board and spend an item to flip face-up, and which are integral to defeating some of the foes.;The monsters all have very different methods required to destroy them, which are again different from those in the original, and this is where the game gets much of its charm. To defeat Medusa, for example, you must ensure that she sees her reflection in each of four mirrors placed on the board. You can force her to move by going to her location and spending an orange item, which lets you move her a number of spaces equal to the number printed on the item counter. After being reflected in all four mirrors, using further orange items to move her to her lair, she can then be defeated there by spending green items.;Monsters can also move after a player’s turn, which requires them to flip over the top card of the monster deck, place a specified number of items on the board, resolve an event, and move one or more monsters. They move toward the closest target, so as well as spending items to move Medusa, you can also try and lure her towards mirrors by offering a tempting target. This is typical of the way the game offers you interesting dilemmas to solve that revolve around the most efficient way to pick up and use items.;While that sounds like a rather dry exercise, in practice it’s anything but. The whole board hums with activity, not only monsters attacking but also legends, non-player standees that are introduced by event cards. Legends want to get back to their home space and can be moved with actions from adjacent players. They will reward you with a helpful card if you get them there. But in the meantime they’re defenseless monster meat that need protecting. Monsters attack players or legends via a die roll which can hit, miss, or trigger a special ability: Medusa sends players to the furthest temple space. Between dice rolls and cards, it’s a thrill-ride game that feels very much alive even without the cunning of a human opponent.;What makes things really interesting, however, is that you’re playing against multiple foes at once. This means you’ve got to prioritize a number of different threats, and each monster’s specific pathway to defeat can dovetail in all sorts of interesting ways. The Siren’s has a memory element. The Minotaur requires you to solve a simple puzzle. The others involve different combinations of item spending and dice rolls but, as an example, the Basilisk needs a lot of orange items so if you’re playing against it and the Medusa demands difficult trade-offs.;While none of the mechanical concepts behind the monsters are especially imaginative, they’re good examples of the way the game gets lots of variety out of simple mechanics. This isn’t a difficult game to learn -- it plays in less than an hour, and it requires players to work together, making it fantastic family fare. Although it has the common issue in cooperative board games that a particularly experienced, or loud, player can boss the others around, everyone has an independent character to control and their own hand of perk cards, so they can do their own thing.;Compared with the original, Horrified: Greek Monsters feels slightly more difficult to beat, largely because of the lairs. They suck actions and items out of the game while you hunt for the ones you need to defeat the enemies, which is a bit of a crapshoot. This adds some excitement, but it can make the difficulty a bit uneven, depending on whether you find what you need early on. It’s also hard not to feel that the monsters themselves are less interesting than the original foes, both thematically and mechanically. The puzzle to beat The Minotaur is just less interesting than the puzzle to beat The Mummy, for example. And there’s nothing like the cool double-header of Frankenstein and his Wife.;For more like this, check out our roundups of the best board games for kids, the best horror board games, and the best cheap board games.\", 'The whole board hums with activity')\n",

But it got that way by spreading itself quite thin, making a lot of gamers fairly happy rather than bringing ecstasy to smaller fanbases. There are times when the lack of theme and long-term strategy makes it feel more like an exercise than a game and it’s a tad too involved for casual family play. But whatever kind of games you like, if you fancy taking the plunge, you’re almost guaranteed to find plenty of enjoyment.', '7 Wonders is a fun game, a good way to pass a half hour, with a great balance of luck and strategy.', \"Civilization games have always been popular but they tend to be long and complex and thus hard to get to the table. 7 Wonders’ claim to fame is that it’s a card-based civilization game that you can teach and play to completion in well under an hour. Such is the appeal of this concept that since its release in 2010 it’s been showered with an endless parade of awards and sold so strongly that it’s had an overhaul reprint and a slew of expansions that have kept it relevant and popular to this day. It's well on its way to becoming a classic board game.;Like a lot of high-concept card games, 7 Wonders comes in a big box that’s largely empty. The top layer of contents consists of two token punchboards, a rulebook and a pile of reference sheets. Beneath that there’s a storage tray that holds player boards, each printed with a different wonder of the world, a pad of scoring sheets, and some decks of cards.;Most of the space on the boards and cards is devoted to artwork, a pleasing blend of realism with a little bit of artistic licence.;See our picks for the best strategy board games.;If you’re wondering why a publisher would put such relatively meagre content into such a large box, the answer is marketing. Having a big box front makes your game stand out on the shelf, allowing it to compete with full-sized board games. And in terms of design and play testing, card games take just as much time and effort as board games of similar complexity so there’s an argument they ought to be treated on equal terms.;7 Wonders didn’t become popular purely because it condensed civilization games into a small space: on release, it was also very novel as one of the first games to make card drafting the core of proceedings. There are three ages to each game and at the start of each age, players get a handful of cards. They choose one to add to their civilization and then pass the rest to a neighbor, while they receive cards from their other neighbor. Then they choose a card from that selection, pass them on and so on until there’s only one card left.;The cards available vary by age but they all represent the trappings of a growing civilization. Age one cards provide things like raw materials and crafted goods alongside basic military and entertainment buildings, the latter of which score you victory points. By age two, most of the cards require that your civilization has some raw materials or goods available. 7 Wonders doesn’t track production: if you already have a card that produces something, it’s presumed available to help pay for other cards. Some structures can also be built for free if you have a prerequisite structure in the chain.;What if you don’t have the raw materials needed for a card? Well, if your neighbors produce it, you can give them coins to essentially “borrow” it for a turn. Getting coins is simply a matter of discarding a card on your turn instead of adding it to your civilization. This is one of the two small ways you can interact with other players in 7 Wonders, but it can be surprisingly effective. It’s painful to have to give up your cash to a competitor who’s doing well and in rare but vicious occasions you can starve your neighbour of a much-needed resource by simply choosing never to add it to your tableau.;The other, much simpler, interaction is through the military. At the end of every age, you compare how many military icons you have on your civilization’s cards with each neighbor. For each that has more than you, you lose a victory point. For each where you’re the victor, you gain points depending on the age, getting more as the game goes on. This is pretty toothless in terms of interaction but it can certainly swing games, especially the big age three bonuses.;In addition to the cards, each civilization starts with a wonder. Rather than playing cards or discarding them for coins, the third and final use is to use them to construct a stage of your wonder which, like card play, costs resources and offers rewards. Wonders, however, tend to have much higher requirements and much more impactful effects than cards. Most of them give you victory points or additional resources but some have more complex effects like building cards from the discard pile. The second edition has better-balanced wonders than the original, but they’re still not perfect.;Picking the right time to devote a card to your wonder isn’t straightforward: you need to trade off whether you’d rather play the card, whether you can afford it and what the possible ramifications are for future picks. And that, essentially, is the same smorgasbord of strategies you’ll be pondering on every card you play, deliciously varied with the shuffle on each game. It’s slick and strangely satisfying, especially the anticipation of waiting to see what might come around again, or fall into your lap in future ages. But it’s not especially demanding and that dichotomy is key to the success of 7 Wonders and makes it appealing as a family board game.;It’s also not particularly reliable or thematic. A lot comes down to luck of the draw or the luck of what other people choose to pass back to you, and there’s no sense that you’re building something coherent step by step. You can play the game with up to seven players and it barely takes any longer because the card drafting is simultaneous. But it works best at smaller player counts because otherwise any sense of being able to predict what might come around again is lost in the scrum. In fact, the two-player 7 Wonders: Duel made our list of the best board games for couples. With its plethora of adding, checking and chaining buildings it’s also a lot less accessible than its bare-bones rules might make it seem.;Due to the chaining rules that let you get certain cards for free, the expansions for 7 Wonders don’t actually mess very much with the card pool. Instead, each adds more wonders alongside a new board or mechanic that extends the game. While this approach adds interest and depth to the base game, it also reduces the accessibility that’s such an important part of its charm. So they’re very much an acquired taste and generally best reserved for seasoned fans.;Armadas is perhaps the best of them, although it’s also the most involved. It allows players to build ships which they can use to move and explore on a separate board in the hope of finding bonus resources. It also adds a second kind of military conflict where players total and compare their naval strength alongside the normal military from the core game.;See 7 Wonders Expansions at Amazon;Leaders and Cities are the two you’d most expect to see as expansions to a civilization-style game. The former offers a brief draft of leader cards before each age draft, which can give you more long-term strategic options to work with, in a primarily tactical game. The latter does add new cards to the main draft which have fun effects like avoiding the military race for one age or even making a neighbor lose coins. However, both also increase the amount of entropy in the game by adding more cards into the drafting mechanic that might or might not be an option for you just when you need them.;Edifice bills itself as a new expansion for the second edition but that’s not entirely true: it’s more of a distillation of the best bits of the Babel expansion for the previous edition. Alongside two new wonders it gives each age a “project,” a sort of vanity project that all the players can contribute to. You can do this only when you build a wonder stage and also have the necessary resources required by the project on top of those needed for your wonder. This gains you a pawn from the project and there are always fewer pawns than players.;If all the pawns are taken, the project is finished and all those who contributed get the printed reward. If it isn’t, then anyone who failed to contribute instead gets a victory point penalty. Of all the expansions, Edificies is the one that changes the feel of the game the most, giving it a much more concrete sense of interaction. There’s a clear race, with an attendant sense of urgency, within each age and it adds to the tactical timing of your decisions, too. It does so without excessive additional rules or randomness. So it’s a neat addition to the lineup, but it might be almost too transformative for newer players.;For more, check out our picks for the best 2-player board games, the best board games for kids, and the best Star Wars board games.\", '7 Wonders’ claim to fame is that it’s a card-based civilization game you can teach and play in well under an hour;Wonders, however, tend to have much higher requirements and much more impactful effects than cards')\n",

There are so many tiles that the game even includes a special tray to sort and store those that don’t belong in the supplied draw bags.;The fold-out board showing a map of Stardew Valley as well as lots of bookkeeping spaces, plus some decks of cards, dice and pawns round out the contents. The game uses standard gaming pawns rather than miniatures or standees and the dice are custom printed.;Everything is illustrated in a fun cartoon style that’s very reminiscent of the source game without veering into pixel art and looks appropriate for a family board game. It gives the game a strong sense of identity, at once evoking the video game version while still clearly being its own thing. The whole assemblage looks great set up on the table, even without the benefit of miniatures.;Given that the video game offers a smooth, tutorial-based introduction, you might be surprised to find that Stardew Valley: The Board Game is moderately complex. At the start of the game, you’ll deal out a selection of objectives from two decks. One is Grandpa’s Goals, which give varied, high-level targets like each player ending the game with three friends, or exploring down to the bottom of the mine. The other deck determines what’s needed to repair rooms in the community center. These are resource-based, requiring quantities of things like gold, fish or minerals and start face-down. Your play group will need to work together to reveal and achieve them all in order to win.;At the start of each turn, there’s a season card that either shows a festival or a chain of pre-turn effects that can run from rain watering your fields to having the wicked Joja Corp slap charges onto board locations. There’s a lot of variety here, including additional sub-event decks for more detail and it really helps keep players on their toes and engage with what would otherwise be a dull phase of book-keeping.;Actual play involves you choosing a location on the board and either taking two relevant actions there or taking one then moving to an adjacent location to take a second action there and scavenging along the route. Location actions include things like buying seeds at Pierre’s General Store in town, planting them and then moving to the fields to water and possibly harvest them. Over time you can fish in various locations, buy buildings and animals for your farm, explore the mine and give items to the museum.;For the most part, actions allow you to obtain or exchange resources that you can use to pursue the game’s goals. And the first time you play, you might be in for a surprise. While the Stardew Valley video game has a reputation as a chill activity, the board game is quite demanding. With some of your goals secret, you need to reveal some early and then construct a game plan to get them fulfilled. And if you don’t plan well, it’s very possible to lose.;If you’d prefer to play a more relaxed session then Stardew Valley: The Board Game has you covered with some less challenging difficulty sessions. But from the point of view of the average cooperative board game, this is good stuff. It rewards repeat plays to learn the nuances of the strategy and encourages groups to work together and come up with creative solutions to problems. The varied goals ensure this process is never straightforward, while the random shuffle of cards and roll of dice ensures it never becomes mechanical.;However, those random effects do create problems with some of the objectives. One of Grandpa’s Goals involves reaching the bottom of the mine and exploring down there is a mixture of dice rolls and card draws and can be extremely capricious. Another objective requires legendary fish which are very rare and you’re reliant on luck to pull them out of the bag of fish tiles, followed by needing a successful dice roll to catch them.;You can of course just leave out the most luck-based objectives before you deal them out, but luck is baked into the entire system. To reveal the community centre objectives you need hearts. To get hearts you need friends and to get friends you need to give them a gift but you won’t know what gift until you meet them by flipping the card. This can cost precious time in a game that’s usually tight, but all you can do is try to ameliorate the luck by collecting as many different items as possible before you try to gain a friend.;It’s also a game that tends to tail off toward the close. Revealing objectives, creating a plan to fulfill them and then seeing that come together as your farm grows and prospers are the key parts of the appeal here. Aside from the excitement of tile draws, actual turns are a bit mechanical and start to feel repetitive as the game draws to a conclusion. Often it’ll be clear whether or not you’re going to win a couple of turns before you get there.;For more, check out our roundups of the best cheap board games, the best board games for parties, and the best board games for 5 year olds.', 'While the Stardew Valley video game has a reputation as a chill activity, the board game is quite demanding')\n",

But that doesn’t stop it from being an entertaining light game that strikes a good balance between strategy and second-guessing. It won’t please fans of heavier strategy but for everyone else, with its simple rules and bright components, it makes for a fun-filled outing to the high seas.', '', 'Back in 2012, the pirate-themed title Libertalia, from a then little-known designer called Paolo Mori hit the shelves. Its blend of bluffing and hand management with that popular piratical theme made it a minor hit -- but after stock sold out it sunk without trace.;As it transpired, it’s a favourite of Stonemaier game’s Jamey Stegmaier, who has now bought the considerable might of his publishing house to issue a new edition. Moving the action from the high seas to the higher skies, Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest (see it at Amazon) adds some new cards and refreshes the components for modern board game production values.;Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest is mostly a card game, with an identical deck for each player, and the cards themselves are something of a letdown. While sturdy enough for play, the art, depicting anthropomorphic pirate animals, is odd. The aim is to emphasise the move from the high seas to high fantasy but the execution is lacking.;Other components are much better. There’s a big bag of chunky plastic loot tiles to draw from, similar to those in Azul (which made our list of the best family board games), which slide and clack in a most satisfying manner as you rummage around amongst them. Players have score dials to track their booty and there are also coin tokens with a fun little plastic treasure chest to keep them in.;The only other component is a board plus some tiles to place on it to vary the effects of the loot tokens. It’s double-sided, printed with player aids and everything is laid out in a neat and effective manner to help facilitate the gameplay.;At the start of Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest, one player shuffles their deck of forty crew cards and draws six at random. The other players then go fishing in their own decks and draw out the same, matching cards. So everyone starts with the same cards. You also draw out one loot tile per player to lay on the board for each day of the upcoming voyage. There are three such voyages, starting at four days and then increasing to five and six.;Each day players must choose a card from their hand in secret. The card will have a rank number and one or more special powers. Once all players have chosen, the cards are arranged in rank order and their “day” powers get activated from left to right, in increasing rank. Then, their “dusk” powers get activated in the opposite direction, highest rank first, after which the owning player can choose a loot tile from that day’s selection. These loot tiles sometimes also have a dusk effect which happens as they are picked. Finally, a few cards have a “night” effect which is applied simultaneously.;That’s pretty much all the rules: it’s very easy to learn and teach the basic game flow. But beware, because the devil is in the details. The special powers on both crew and tiles are very varied and spice proceedings up like a tot of rum. At the same time, the information you need to play strategically is printed on the cards and tile effects and makes the game feel more complicated to newcomers than the tiny rule booklet.;Let’s illustrate this with an example. Loot tiles aren’t all equal in value: indeed one, the Relic, costs you points if you collect it. So if there’s a day with a couple of Relic tiles among the loot and you have the rank 5 card Cabin Boy, you might be tempted to play it. The Cabin Boy’s “day” power nets you gold if he’s the leftmost card, which is likely given that he’s rank 5. At “dusk” he stops you from taking any loot which, if it’s a Relic, is quite helpful. So he looks like an easy choice: except all the other players will have a Cabin Boy and they’ll all be thinking the same thing. All of a sudden he’s not likely to be the leftmost card anymore, and you might want to reconsider. Unless all the other players are also thinking that same thing, in which case ...;And so the decisions go on, like a galleon spinning in an endless whirlpool, until you’ve tried to out-think all the double-think and come to a conclusion, as in all great strategy board games. After the tension of waiting for the other players, you go up the scale and back down again, scrabbling to try and work out what the cascade of powers is going to be and what loot you’re going to secure. It’s a neat mechanic with plenty of scope for excitement, planning and bluff. At the same time, the simultaneous choice of cards means your strategies can and will get torpedoed through no fault of your own, which can be unsatisfying.;At the end of each voyage, some cards and most loot tokens also have an “anchor” power that activates. These mostly net you some bonus gold but there are fun exceptions such as the hook token that lets you keep a card you’ve played in your tableau, which can be handy if it has an ongoing “night” effect. Libertalia: Wind of Galecrest makes full use of the simple day, dusk, night and anchor system to come up with some really engaging effect combos, ensuring there’s plenty of variety among its motley crew. The flip side of the board even has a whole new set of loot token effects to increase player interaction.;Before starting a new voyage, players get six new cards for their hand -- and this is where things really start to heat up. Although all players get the same six cards, chances are they played different cards during the preceding voyage which means everyone is now holding different hands. This brings a memory element into the game as you’ll be at an advantage if you can recall what other players are holding; but either way, it opens up more variety in potential effect combos. Despite this fresh blood, the arbitrary nature of simultaneous play does make the hour-odd play time feel a little overlong.;One thing that comes as a particular surprise for a game that thrives off having lots of cards working in opposition to each other is that it works well as both a solo board game and a two-player board game. Played solitaire, there’s a simple AI system to choose cards from an opponent’s hand together with a random “pilferer” card to mix up the order. With two players, there’s a dummy rank 20 card that punishes low play by stealing a loot token if both players have cards that rank below it. These are neat, simple solutions that keep the game fast and fun at every player count.;For more, check out our roundups of the best trivia board games, the best board games for couples, and the best board games for 5 year olds.', 'It’s very easy to learn and teach the basic game flow.

This game ups it to the next level, allowing long links of actions that are challenging and satisfying to pull off. With lots more depth and variety than the average roll and write, Three Sisters is a great addition to the genre, so long as you’re happy with its insular and sometimes confusing play style.', 'Three Sisters offers a surprisingly deep and strategic take on the roll-and-write genre.', 'From the large pumpkins on the box and the connection between the name and a witch’s coven, you could be forgiven for thinking that Three Sisters (see it on Amazon) is a game about Halloween. In fact, it’s a game about farming: Three Sisters is a name given to a complimentary planting method used in Mesoamerica since antiquity. The pumpkin plant covers the ground, preventing weeds, and it’s planted with corn and beans, the latter of which uses the former as a trellis.;This unlikely theme is the inspiration for a roll-and-write game, where players roll and pick dice, filling in parts of their scoresheet. Yahtzee is the best-known game in this classic board game genre thanks to its mass-market production, but Three Sisters is about as far from Yahtzee as you can get.;Like most roll-and-write games, the bulk of the box in Three Sisters is taken up with score sheets you can rip off and write on to play. Unlike most such games, it has two separate sheets. One tracks your garden of flowers and vegetables. The other has your shed, your beehives, a long track for the goods you’ll produce, and a space to make notes. This latter addition may strike you as odd, but you’ll soon find out why it’s helpful.;The art is fine, all the greens and oranges you’d expect in a growing garden. The remaining components consist of some neat orange custom dice with pumpkin icons where the “1” should be and some wooden components. There’s a pumpkin for the first player, a cylinder to track the round, and a black wooden farmer token to follow the current space on the rondel.;There are eight rounds in a game of Three Sisters and each starts by rolling a pool of dice based on the number of players. You sort dice into groups of the same value and then place each group on a space on the board, following a cycle called a rondel. Each space on the rondel corresponds to an action you can take in-game: the dice roll thus limits what actions are available.;Players then take turns to choose a dice and take the corresponding action. First, though, they get to tend their garden. At the top of one of the score sheets, there are six zones of boxes for pumpkins, which give you goods to sell at the market, and corn and beans, which give you points. In the zone matching the die you chose you can either make two new plants or water, which allows all the existing plants to grow a box.;Other actions include growing one of several fruits, tending to your hive of bees, getting a box of goods to sell, the market itself and the shed. This latter lets you cross off boxes from a wide range of tools that give you special powers. They run from mason jars, which let you sell fruit harvests as an additional good, to a tractor which does nothing but scores you a whopping eighteen points if you can fill in all its boxes.;If you grow two adjacent pumpkins to full height you can also take a perennial action and, like fruit, there’s a range of these. Hyacinths give you bonus goods, for example, while hydrangeas give you bonus fruit-growing actions. You also get perennial actions for selling goods at the market, and the more goods you have the more such actions you’ll gain. Filling up your goods track also gets you free actions which can be spent on fruit, perennials or the hive as you so choose.;As you might gather, Three Sisters is pretty complex as roll and write games go, although that’s still simpler than a lot of its bigger brothers. But there’s another reason we’ve labored over the rules rather than telling you upfront how it plays, and that’s because you have to have an understanding of how all the game elements intersect before you can understand what makes it special.;Let’s say, in your turn, you choose to take a free goods action. First, you get to water, and that will grow some pumpkins to increase your goods track. This nets you a free action, which you spend on some raspberries to increase your goods track even more. Combined with your pumpkin harvest, that gets you a second bonus action, and you haven’t even filled in your free goods yet! Even with two unresolved actions in the bank, that grown pumpkin brackets a perennial so you can take that action too: and resolving those three actions could net you even more actions.;This is why there’s a notes space on the scoresheet: so you can track unresolved actions while you work out your turn. These huge chains of combos are what Three Sisters is all about, and they’re great. Taxing to work through and work out to maximise their potential, satisfying to execute and often banking big swings of points into the bargain. Few other roll and write games go down this strategy game route, and none quite as well as here.;Because players take individual dice, rather than all working off the same roll as in most games of this genre, turns can be a little slow. But people can be left to sort out their combo chains by themselves other players take their actions. It’s easy to make mistakes, though, and accidentally miss an action or do something that’s not strictly allowed. It also makes for a very heads-down kind of game where you’re concentrating on your own scoresheet and not caring what other players are doing. The only sound is the scratching of pencils and the occasional ooh and aah over a particularly big scoring cascade.;The complexity of the scoresheet does lend itself to trying multiple strategies, though. While grabbing a couple of shed items early looks like a no-brainer decision, after that you can prosper in all sorts of routes. Your garden, your apiary, your fruit orchard, market sales and your perennial borders are all big sources of points and all support each other in different ways. So while your choices may be shaped early by the fate of the dice there are lots of different strategic routes to explore as the game progresses.;For more, check out our picks for the best three-player board games, the best cheap board games, and the best trivia board games.', 'These huge chains of combos are what Three Sisters is all about, and they’re great.

You’d imagine that real-life roaring monsters stalking the actual earth would be an endless source of design inspiration, yet games featuring them are relatively few and far between. One of the best is Dinosaur Island - republished as Dinosaur World - which tasks players with building and managing their very own version of Jurassic World. It’s a great game if you can stand the sauropod-like weight of rules and play time.;For those of us without geological periods of time in which to play games, the same designers have invented a streamlined alternative, Dinosaur Island: Rawr n’ Write (see it at Amazon). The title riffs on the popular roll-and-write board game genre where a pool of dice is rolled and players mark down the results on a scoresheet. You’ve probably played Yahtzee, but this is a much bigger beast.;Beneath the rules and a simple card-holding board, the main component of Dinosaur Island: Rawr n’ Write is two big pads of scoresheets. This in itself is unusual: most roll and write games only have one. Closer inspection reveals them to both be packed with detail, and you may need to squint to see all the boxes. You can print your own, too, via online copies freely available from the publisher, and they also supply an app to use, although it’s fiddly.;At the bottom of the box are decks of specialist and building cards, illustrated in a fun cartoon style that helps bring the setting to life and feels appropriate to a family board game. There are also custom dice printed with esoteric-looking symbols on translucent orange-yellow plastic. These are clearly supposed to be amber, although in a certain light they can’t help but resemble another common, naturally occurring fluid.;Dinosaur Island: Rawr n’ Write plays out over the course of three tourist seasons. Each consists of two rounds of dice-drafting to gain and spend resources on adding staff and buildings to the map of your park, followed by an actual tour around those attractions. Staff give you an immediate reward plus an additional bonus on each tour. A guide, for example, makes your park more exciting for visitors and lets you add roads before a tour. There are three default staff hires every game, including the guide, plus another three randomly dealt to make sure the options are different on every play.;There are a lot of resources in this game, especially for a roll-and-write title, which are normally stripped down for simplicity and speed. Money is one, which you’ll need to recruit staff, buy buildings and lay road between them. On occasion, you may also get dice faces that give you a whole building or a couple of roads. DNA is another. It comes in three simple and three “advanced” flavors which you can pair up to create up to nine dinosaur species, from Triceratops to Tyrannosaurs. Dinosaurs also add “threat” to your park which you can offset with the final resource, security.;All the dice in Dinosaur Island: Rawr n’ Write are different, and you draw a selection to roll each round based on the number of players plus one extra. Choosing which dice to take from the pool is always a fraught decision with a lot of factors to consider. It’s not just about deciding on the most important resources but what you’ll miss out on, too. You might want DNA for dinosaurs, but if you do, you’ll need to ameliorate any gained threat. Similarly, your attractions will be less valuable if you don’t have roads to connect them to your tour. It’s a very tricky logical balancing act, with added tension from the fact that all the players gain the resources plus an amount of threat from the final, leftover dice.;Once you’ve chosen two dice, you get to use them to take actions from a choice of six. Most gain additional resources or buildings, so it’s a way to catch up on things you missed during the drafting phase. However, breeding dinosaurs is only available as an action, so that space is hotly contested. If you want to take an action another player has already used that’s fine, but you’ll gain extra threat from the dice they’ve placed there, so it can be a risky option.;The way all the different resources are necessary for different aspects of your park makes this far more of a brain-burner than most games in the genre and marking it as a strategy board game. However, with brain-burn comes its unwelcome cousin, analysis paralysis, where players get hung up on all the possible permutations and take a while to make a move. It’s particularly acute here due to the tight integration of resources and the two-step process of drafting and actions which make it difficult to plan ahead. Turns can be slow, especially as the player count rises, but moves especially well as a game for couples.;When you first create a new dinosaur species you can add its paddock as a building to your park for free. Others include funfair rides and merch stands, as well as a random selection of three buildings, dealt anew for each game. Whenever you build something, you draw it on the grid map of your park. The aim for the end of each of the three seasons is to have a route that leads from your HQ, via roads through as many new buildings as possible, and out of a park exit. You can only use a building an exit once per tour, which is a bit contrived but does add to the strategic planning.;Despite this affectation, the park tour is a neat touch that really brings the game to life. Suddenly you’re not just juggling numbers on a spreadsheet any more, you’re whisking tourists through the greatest show on earth, a show that you planned and built and executed. Your reward is a buildup of “excitement,” another track on the sheet that brings in rewards in the form of resources and victory points.;However, tours are where it can also all go wrong if your threat count is ahead of your security. The first couple of times this happens, the dead tourists can be hushed up. But keep inviting disaster and you’ll have to destroy parts of your hard-built park and the rewards they provide. While this is fun and thematic, in practice it’s a little too easy to stay ahead of the threat curve and most of the time you can avoid the most serious repercussions.;For more family-friendly fun, check out our picks for the best quick-playing board games, the best three-player board games, and the best board games for 5 year olds.', None)\n",

The original 1979 Dune was a brilliant behemoth but has always been very hard to get to the table. This version retains its essentials yet feels like a very different game. It’s been transformed from a slow burn of bluff, negotiation, and strategy into a fast, fun, and often quite random game of all-out aggression. In retaining its narrative asymmetry and that all-important battle wheel, though, it has also retained its reason to exist, and the hope that it might introduce its bigger brother to a new generation of gamers.', 'This new version of the Dune board game is a fast, fun, and often quite random game of all-out aggression.', 'With the advent of the 2021 Dune movie, this famous sci-fi franchise is now well served with game adaptations, such as the excellent Dune: Imperium, which is included on our list of the best deck-building board games. But it wasn’t always this way. For a long time, there was only one Dune game -- also called Dune -- that was first released in 1979 but which has cast a long and impressive shadow over gaming ever since. Years ahead of its time, it was a brilliant evocation of the source material with one of the most nail-biting combat mechanisms ever invented.;However, it also needed a full complement of six players for full effect and had a play time that could last anywhere from an hour to most of the day. Trying to make the core of the game more flexible for modern board game tastes has long been seen as an almost impossible design goal. But that hasn’t stopped publisher Gale Force Nine from trying, with the clumsily titled Dune: A Game of Conquest and Diplomacy (see it at Amazon).;If you’ve played an edition of the original Dune game this is based on, the components will look very familiar. There’s a board depicting the surface of the planet as a circular map, which is functionally identical to its predecessor. The art is perhaps clearer, although less stylized than previous editions.;Three sheets of card punchboard hold a mass of spice tokens, leader disks, the infamous battle wheels and some other tokens. The face images on the leaders are taken from the movie adaptation. The battle wheels are large and must be pinned together, front to back, with the two halves sliding loosely against each other.;On Sale at Amazon;At the bottom are four decks of cards to track traitors, the spice blow, battle artifacts and the market of tricks and tools. These are also well illustrated with a mixture of custom art and that based on images from the film. However, they’re so thin that they barely qualify for the word “card” above thick paper. Sturdy card sleeves will be required if you don’t want them disintegrating.;Dune: A Game of Conquest and Diplomacy lives up to the first half of its name. Winning means controlling three out of the five strongholds on the planet’s surface with your troops at the end of a turn. If no one has managed that after five turns, you add up points. Five for each stronghold you control plus the amount of spice, used in this game as a currency, to see who emerges as the victor.;This tight turn limit gives the game a much more reliable and manageable time table than the older version of the game, and it generally plays in around an hour unless someone takes an early win. But it also obviates the second part of its long name, and a key component of the previous game: negotiation. With so few turns and no rules to allow allied victories, it’s every player for themselves. It’s an unfortunate loss but a necessary one to keep a lid on the play time.;What’s been retained, though, is the battle wheel, the merciless engine by which you win territories. It’s such a great idea that it’s astonishing it hasn’t been copied more frequently. In a fight, each player secretly selects a weapon and perhaps some weapon or defense cards from their reserves. Then, still in secret, they dial a number of the wheel which cannot exceed the troops they have in the fight. The plans are then revealed and all the values added up: the loser loses all their forces, while the winner loses only the number of troops they dialed.;It’s hard to overstate how excruciating these decisions are. Dialing one short can lead to a catastrophic loss, whereas dialing one too many can leave you unable to defend your newly-won territory. As if this wasn’t enough tension, you may find your opponent has already turned your leader into a traitor, or that a poor choice of weapon or defense cards means they die in the fight so you don’t get their battle value or the chance to lose them again.;With such huge stakes, the decisions can feel paralyzing. And this is where Dune: A Game of Conquest and Diplomacy diverges hugely from its predecessor both for good and ill. On the plus side the shorter game time makes it easier to choose and easier to bear if you screw things up. On the minus side, cards and traitors are largely a crapshoot in this edition, whereas in the older game there were glimmers of intelligence to be gained as the game unfolded, allowed more informed choices.;Aside from controlling strongholds, the other vital element is control of spice. This appears at random on the board according to card draw and is an immediate lure to set up further armed clashes. You need spice to buy cards and to ship troops from your reserves onto the planet’s surface, from where they are able to move short distances across the desert. But beware as a raging sandstorm moves at the whim of the dice around the circular board like the hand of a clock, destroying forces left out in the open for an added dose of strategic disquiet.;Another key thing that’s been retained is the game’s asymmetry. There are four factions here rather than six, the Bene Gesserit having been folded in to the Emperor and the Guild being purged completely. But each still offers a sense of playing in the paper shoes of that faction from the book. The Atredies can use Paul’s prescience to force an opponent to reveal part of their battle plan. The Harkonnen get extra traitors. The Imperium gets the spice when other players buy cards. Finally, the Fremen can move around the hostile surface of the planet freely and easily.;These matchups slot into their narrative roles well, however many players you have, creating a believable retelling of the novel’s story.

The idea of having the cards across the regions attack each other is obvious, but it’s novel nevertheless and it adds a whole new dimension to this great genre. The elemental powers are well planned to offer lots of variety, too. Good as it is, however, a propensity for turning close finishes into damp squibs stops it from sitting right at the top of the card pile.', 'A smartly designed fantasy card game with very few drawbacks.', \"Back in 1995, famed game designer Reiner Knizia invented a simple two-player Poker variant you could play with a deck of playing cards. Rather than a betting game, it saw players trying to complete several poker-style hands on their side of the table, trying to get a better result than their opponent’s opposite. It was a sort of area control game with a standard deck and it proved so good it spawned an entire genre, the best known of which is Knizia’s customized design Schotten Totten. (For more Knizia, see our list of the best 90s board games.);Riftforce (See it on Amazon) is the latest spin on this tug of war formula. Underneath a tiresome and generic fantasy setting, its twist is that rather than trying to make groups of cards, you’re using your plays to attack those on your opponent’s side. It might not sound enough to make this stand out from the crowd, but looks can often be deceiving.;This is a card-only game, so it comes in a small, neat box filled with cards and a single sheet of tokens to punch out. There’s nothing in particular to praise or condemn about the contents: they’re functional, with good, evocative art.;You start a game of Riftforce with a fast, simple but high impact deck-building round. The game comes with ten sets of elemental cards, each in the same mix of 5, 6 and 7 health. What’s different about them is their special powers. Lightning elementals deal 2 damage to a card opposite and can repeat the effect if it kills the target. Fire elementals, meanwhile, do 3 damage but also deal 1 damage to a friendly card behind them. Players take turns choosing a set for their deck until each has four.;In the middle of the table between you are five regions. On your turn, you can do one of three things. The first is to play up to three cards of the same number of elemental types from your hand into your side of these regions. That’s what you’ll want to do on your first turn. The second is to discard a card to activate the special powers of cards you’ve played matching the number or elemental type of your discard. The third action lets you score a point for any region where only you have cards on your side, then fill your hand up to seven cards.;These are essentially the entire rules to Riftforce: it’s simple to learn and fast to play. The only thing that’ll trip you up is remembering the special power each set of elementals has, but there are reference cards for that. Yet you’d never imagine such a straightforward set of obstacles could tie you in so many tactical knots.;Like all games in this genre, that’s partly because you’re having to balance what’s in your hand with what you’ve got on the board. It might be tempting to dump out three 7-health elementals on your very first turn if you have them: experience will demonstrate they’re very hard to defeat. But unless you have further matching cards to activate them, you could just be providing cannon fodder for your opponent.;And so the dance begins as you weave around each other, jostling for position on opposite sides of each region, trying not to give your plans away, hoping that luck will deliver what you need the next time you draw up. Although the regular rhythm of having to refill your hand stops you from planning much in the way of strategy, the tactical play hums with excitement and anticipation. It's a great two player game.;Some of this is down to the nature of this genre, but a lot of it comes from those elemental powers. You might not imagine that a few variations on damage dealing could be so consequential, but Riftforce does a lot of heavy lifting with its straightforward concepts. Some elementals, like Air, can move around but do relatively little damage: a mere one point to the opposite card and its adjacent regions in that case. But that can be very valuable, whisking your elemental out of danger, or allowing you to threaten an empty region.;Between the damage dealing and the moving and managing your hand, there’s a lot to keep you busy here. And as you’ll discover over your first few games, the special powers also bring a new dimension to the card draft that starts the game. While there are no bad elementals in the game, some tribes do work better with others. Once understood, it’s a race not only to try and get the pairings you favor but to stop your opponent from doing the same. And all the different combinations ensure there’s a lot of variety across games.;It’s also worth noting the effect that splitting the playing of cards from activating them has on the game. One of the elementals does a point of damage when played; the rest need to be activated, and it’s a testament to this mechanic that that single immediate point can be quite powerful. Having to wait to power up your cards on the board keeps the tension high as you wait to see what your opponent can do with their cards, and what you’ll have left to respond.;However, that core rhythm of playing, activating and refilling can be problematic. Victory is the first to twelve points, which are scored by contesting empty regions or, more commonly, by killing enemy cards. Close games are common so long as both players handle their decks well. And when it’s close, the question of who creeps over that line first sometimes feels like it comes down to who has to give up momentum and refill. That’s a consequence of player choice, of course, but it’s not one you can foresee, and it can feel frustrating as a result.;That said, the game is so quick and easy to learn and play that the occasional flat hand isn’t a major issue. You can just rack them up and start again, with the chance to re-jig your elemental synergies to try out new tactics.;Need more to scratch that gaming itch?

If you’re new to, or suspicious of, this difficult genre, Witchstone might just have magic to draw you in.', \"Witchstone is a jumble of a game, with lots of parts that don't necessarily fit together. But it also has an undeniable energy that can turn it into something both fun and exciting.\", \"Reiner Knizia is one of the most famous and prolific board game designers of all time. His work encompasses '90s classic board games like Ra and Modern Art, all the way to modern hits such as The Quest to El Dorado and My City. So when his name appears on a new game such as Witchstone (See it on Amazon), which he co-designed with Martino Chiacchiera, you sit up and take notice.;Beneath the big fold-out board lies a plethora of colorful components. There’s a selection of wooden witch and owl tokens and two different shapes of plastic crystal in each of the four player colors. Plastic can look cheap, and we know it is cheap, but cut gemstones can’t help but to retain a certain allure even when they’re not real.;;The board itself adds to the visual theme by depicting a big crystal ball alongside other items of magical paraphernalia including a wand and a pentagram. There’s a deck of cards, too, although the art is functional and nowhere near as lavish as that on the box and board. Several sheets of cardboard sprue round out the components. These are serviceable enough and include a cauldron board for each player and a whole stack of tokens.;Each turn in Witchstone starts with the player placing a tile from their hand into their cauldron. These tiles are double hexagons with a symbol on each end, and the two symbols indicate which actions you can take that turn. If you can place a symbol against a matching one already in your cauldron, you can take that action twice, or more if you’re increasing the size of a group of icons.;Right off the bat, this is a smart, shifting puzzle to enjoy. You’re caught three ways, between the tiles in your hand, the actions you want to take right now, and setting up symbol groups for the future. If you play this puzzle well, these groups can allow you to take large numbers of actions late in the game. Such big combo turns can often trigger further actions inside them, making them demanding, exciting and game-swinging all at the same time.;One such action is to migrate crystal tokens. These start in your cauldron and block tile placement spaces, so it’s good to get rid of them. If you can move them to the lip of the cauldron you’ll get one or two bonus actions depending on where, exactly, they end up. You also have a special black crystal at the centre of the cauldron which nets you double the effect if it reaches the edge.;This highlights two things about Witchstone. The first is the way in which all the mechanisms tend to cross over, as in the way crystals are bound up with your cauldron strategies. The second is that the rules are unintuitive, awkward and peppered with irritating exceptions.;You see, although Witchstone has all the trappings of a game about magic with its crystals, witches, and owls, it’s not actually about anything. It’s an abstract draped in a sorcerer’s cloak, an excuse to combine a wide range of play styles and mechanics. And while that marriage gives the game a lot of depth and variety, it means the rules don’t relate to any real-world activities and are hard to internalize.;Let’s explore some of the other actions to illustrate these points. Energy actions let you take possession of links between board spaces. These lean into witch actions that mean you can move your pieces onto the main board and move them around. First into particular spaces gain tokens that can be cashed in for bonus actions. Again, you see how the game interlinks its mechanisms and again there are various rules exceptions, which we won’t detail, to learn.;The next two mini-games are the pentagram and the magic wand. The pentagram action lets you move your token around the five points of that board symbol, gaining points or tokens. These can either be cashed in for bonus actions or placed in your cauldron to make bigger symbol groups. The wand is a race for bonus actions, as the first person to reach a given point on the wand track gets double the reward.;All of these action also have the potential to score you points, which is how you inch toward victory. Given the circular nature of how these various routes interlink, you might imagine Witchstone makes it hard to find a starting place to build a strategy. But it has a clever solution in its final action, the scroll, which lets you take a card from a face-up selection. Some of these give you action bonuses but others earn you substantial extra points for doing well at particular mini-games. These make an excellent starting point for your strategizing.;Between them, the effect of these disparate mini-games is to make Witchstone cross a number of genre boundaries. Pooling action combos in your cauldron feels a bit like an engine builder. Jostling for space on the crystal ball gives you a sense of area control. The wand and pentagram are races, where early leaders get bigger rewards. It’s a good mix, offering tidbits to lots of different tastes while retaining plenty of depth from the way the mechanisms interlock.;However, as the old saw goes, Jack of all trades is master of nothing. It’s satisfying to snatch a route away from another player but there’s nowhere near enough direct interaction to stop it being mostly a heads-down affair, for example. And without a unifying theme to tie the whole thing together, it can feel fragmented despite its smart overall design. This is especially true when the game runs long, as it will with more players, and while you’re still getting to grips with its mishmash of unintuitive rules, making this a board game for adults.;The further you venture into the game, though, the more engaging it becomes. The rules become familiar and the increasing power of each of your turns spirals into some real excitement. Toward the end, when your cauldron tiles run out, you can be bagging big combos for huge point swings. Of course, so can all the other players, leading to lots of fun flip-flops over the lead as the game closes out.;For more, check out our picks for the best trivia board games, the best campaign board games, and the best Marvel board games.\", 'Right off the bat, this is a smart, shifting puzzle to enjoy;Although Witchstone has the trappings of a game about magic... it’s not actually about anything')\n",

But there’s no denying that this edition is slicker, faster and more appealing. And getting to play it again after a long hiatus, it’s amazing how fresh and fun building your ship remains. Tabletop gaming has trucked on a long way since 2007, but Galaxy Trucker still leads the convoy in its unique real-time niche.', 'This second edition of Galaxy Trucker adds some smart tweaks to the second half of the game, but it still drags down the experience after the delightful excitement of the first half.', 'Back in 2007, when the original Galaxy Trucker came out, real-time tabletop games were still a novelty. As a result, the novel ship-building system it used where everyone grabbed tiles from the same pile and raced to finish first, made it a big hit.;As time went on, however, the concept proved to have big staying power. While other games explored the real-time design space, Galaxy Trucker (See it on Amazon) carried on selling in droves and received several expansion sets. Now it’s back in stores with a new, tweaked formula to try and appeal to a whole new generation of gamers.;While the cartoon art style might not be to everyone’s tastes, there’s no denying it’s a fresh look that suits the game. The bulk of this weighty box is taken up by card punchboards from which you pop the array of ship-building tiles and other tokens. Joining them are a sand timer, some wooden dice and a deck of cards.;But it’s the plastic components that are the star of this show. Some fun little plastic astronaut and alien figures are here, along with lots of marbled plastic cubes to represent cargo. But best of all are the batteries, little tubes of neon plastic that look like they ought to be sour candy. Don’t eat them.;Galaxy Trucker is literally a game of two halves. In the first, everyone takes tiles from a central pile and tries to construct a ship as fast as possible, following a set of connection rules. In the second, players then take those ships and fly them through an intergalactic obstacle course, trying to collect loot and get it across the finish line.;Ship-building is an absolute blast. There’s a dizzying array of ship components you can add: lasers and shields to protect your ship, thrusters to give you speed, batteries to power them. There are also more esoteric elements including life support for alien crew members that can give bonus speed or strength to your ship.;Despite the array of components at your disposal, it’s easy to learn because the building rules make literal and visual sense, making it a great board games for families. Cannons that don’t point outwards and thrusters anywhere other than the rear of your ship aren’t allowed. You can’t connect an edge with two pipes to an edge with a single pipe, and so on. There’s a time limit, applied by the included sand timer.;Yet however easy the rules are to follow in theory, following them in the heat of snatching face-down tiles from a pile as fast as possible, discarding those you don’t want, is quite another. Let alone the fact that you’re racing to do it against your opponents. Let alone that you want to discard as few as possible since you do so face-up, gifting them to other players. It’s frantic, frenetic and fun, yet still allows cool heads and clever builders to prevail, making it a great board game choice for kids.;Not only are you being distracted by the race aspect, but you can also spend valuable ship-building time looking at the cards which will constitute the upcoming race. This gives you vital information about how you might want to build your ship. If there are a lot of planets or space stations, for example, you can add extra cargo holds to keep the loot you can find there.;Fast players are also in control of when to flip the sand timer, upping the pressure on the other players. Trying to split your time between tiles, cards, and timer while making the best use of both is information overload of the best kind, mental plate-spinning with discs of fire. It’s this combination that makes Galaxy Trucker still stand out among real-time games after thirteen years. Getting the right balance of speed and information is rewarding in every sense, and very hard to do.;Your reward for finishing your ship first is to start the race in pole position, and each other player queues up behind as they finish. But beware! Before you can launch, the other players get to check that you’ve followed the shipbuilding rules. Failure to do so means you have to remove components until it’s legal. In extreme cases, this can almost cripple your ship if you’ve got a connector wrong in the middle of the structure. Worse, the discarded tiles will count as a penalty once the race is finished.;Racing is where the most changes are in this new edition. It’s nothing major: some encounter cards are less drastic, and you now fly a single, longer race with your ship instead of three different ones with new ships. That decreases downtime, making for a shorter, tighter game. If you want to play in the old style, it’s included as a variant.;However, despite the tweaks, racing is still the poor cousin to the ship-building aspect. You flip the top encounter off the shared deck, and then all the players apply the effect in race order. So if you’re leading the pack, you’ll get the first choice of whether to stop to loot cargo or take on crew, with those who do so losing race position as a result. But you’re also first in line for attacks by smugglers or pirates, although there’s a reward for whoever can see them off.;Despite a good variety in the encounters, from meteor swarms to galactic plague, applying the effects feels static and processional compared to the madcap ship construction. The race leader guides everyone through the appropriate actions such as rolling dice to see what part of the ship a meteor strike hits. Sure there’s some excitement, especially when a roll could split your ship in half. But there’s still a sense you’re watching things happen instead of being directly involved.;For your first few races, it’ll also be tempting to believe that between the dice rolls and cards your construction skills won’t count for much. But this is where getting that balance of checking cards while grabbing parts becomes important. If you know there’s a lot of open space in the deck, you go heavy on engines. If there’s a lot of pirates, be sure to build in guns and shields. You can’t check all the cards, so there’s always some surprises even for the best prepared.;At the end, you get a credit bonus depending on your race position, as does the best-built ship. Then everyone totals their proceeds from the race in terms of selling cargo or bounties from defeated pirates to see who wins. Play length is influenced by your choice of ship size - there are three - but you’ll be done in 30-45 minutes, which is spot on for this relatively lightweight title.;Galaxy Trucker (2nd edition) is available at a variety of retailers for an MSRP of $29.99.;For more, check out our picks for the best board games for 5 year olds, the best Marvel board games, and the best trivia board games.', 'Ship-building is an absolute blast;Despite the tweaks, racing is still the poor cousin to the ship-building aspect')\n",

Its auction compensation mechanic is novel and brings a balance of depth and excitement to bidding. Running your engine feels weaker after the white heat of the auction, but there’s still a good sense of fulfillment in growing your pile of cash. Simple and satisfying, Furnace is a timely reminder that in tabletop gaming, newer isn’t necessarily better.', 'Simple and satisfying, Furnace is a timely reminder that in tabletop gaming, newer isn’t necessarily better.', 'In the late ’90s, a certain kind of title came to dominate board gaming. Typified by classic board games like Catan and Carcassonne they were easy to learn and offered with a great balance of strategy, randomness, and player interaction. As time went on, the former came to dominate the latter two and games were heavier and dryer.;Furnace (See it at Amazon) is very much a return to that older paradigm, and for many players it’s a welcome return. Casting players as businessmen during the industrial revolution, you’ll need to buy businesses that create a supply chain from which you can make the most profit. And like a lot of the best games for adults, it’s a whole lot more fun than it might sound.;Strictly speaking, Furnace is a card game because it has no board. Instead, the box contains some cardboard tokens, wood pieces to represent oil, coal and iron, four wooden discs for each player, and some decks of cards. The art is great across all the components, echoing the technical illustrations of the era in which it is set. It also has a novel turn tracker that mimics a turning gear.;What’s not so great is the card quality. They’re of very thin stock which will wear quickly, with an annoying texture that makes them stick to each other but not the table or your fingers. They’re a pain to handle but the issue is easily solved with some cheap card sleeves.;There are four turns in a game of Furnace, each divided into two phases. In the first, some business cards are dealt off the deck and players compete in an auction to win them. In the second you can activate businesses you own one at a time to gain or exchange resources.;Auctions were another popular feature of late ‘90s games, but this one has a clever modern twist. Each player gets four tokens of increasing value and they use them to indicate their bids. The catch is that in Furnace, if you lose an auction you get compensated, either with raw materials or the chance to exchange some for a different type. You can claim this compensation as many times as your bid token. Often, that makes it more valuable to lose an auction than to win it.;This makes the auction phase a relentless and ever-shifting cauldron of competing priorities. Let’s say you want to win a business that can turn coal into cash, which serves as victory points. You can bid high on that, but to make use of it, you’ll also need coal that turn. So you bid low on a business with coal as compensation. But the other players can see this. They may purposefully outbid you on the cash business while leaving your low bid to win the other card, denying you the compensation.;Of course, while it’s tempting to use your bids to screw up other players’ plans, you also need to get your own supply chain running. So it’s a constant multi-way balancing act trying to win what you need while also getting the necessary compensation and putting a spanner in other players’ works at the same time. It’s high stakes too: with only four rounds, you need to take every opportunity to make money or you’ll fall behind fast.;While absorbing and challenging, this dance also has a weakness. A good auction game needs a good tempo, with bids coming in to increase the excitement. But here, players need to bid with great consideration and care, especially in the first two rounds. Waiting while someone lines up the strategies in their head can be a bit frustrating.;In addition to the three core resources, coal, iron, and oil, there’s a fourth more abstract quantity -- upgrade tokens. A few cards let you exchange these for money, but for the most part you want to spend them to upgrade your businesses. Each has two effects: one that you can use after purchase and a second that you can also activate when it’s upgraded. To upgrade, you’ll need to spend resources along with the token, making timing your upgrades critical.;As the game goes on, your ultimate goal is to create a chain of cards that lets you maximize your point-scoring. A business that produces coal, another that lets you exchange coal for oil and a third that can cash in oil - the most valuable resource - for money. Just having such a chain isn’t enough, as exchange effects can only be activated a limited number of times per round. You need a balance, to ensure as many points as possible each turn.;Making this work is the core of the second phase. While not as engaging as the auction, it’s a neat little puzzle in itself. Upgraded businesses have to have their effects in order, without another activation in between so the right order can take some working out. All the more so as the game goes on and your chains become more complex and interdependent. It is a heads-down activity though, with no input from other players. That speeds up the game, with players able to do it simultaneously, although that leaves room for individuals to make rules errors.;Furnace makes those simple rules and three resources work as hard as they can. At the start, each player gets a capitalist card with a special power and a unique starting business. Between them, they provide a variety of guide rails for how you’ll begin building your supply chain. The business cards then offer decent diversity between compensation, resource and exchange effects but the combinations begin to feel thin after a while.;For more, check out our picks for the best quick playing board games, the best board games for 5 year olds, and the best Marvel board games.', 'The art is great across all the components, echoing the technical illustrations of the era')\n",

But these present a significant barrier to new players in terms of digesting rules and collecting a whole army to put into the field. As such, it has long offered cut-down, introductory versions to entice the unwary.;The latest is Warhammer 40,000: Fireteam, in which a squad of close-combat Space Marines take on the sinister, robotic Necrons (see it at Barnes & Noble). However, Fireteam takes a fresh approach by adopting a stripped-down version of the miniatures rules for what is inarguably a war board game. It has cards, a hex grid and there’s not a range ruler to be seen.;Fireteam doesn’t look like much when you slide off the lid. Underneath a double-sided board, each surface printed with an abstract sci-fi battlefield, are a bunch of nondescript orange and white cards of various sizes. It’s when you realize that the box is deeper than the storage tray that the magic happens. Beneath are three sprues of brilliant miniatures.;You’ll need tools, time and ideally some glue to assemble them, but the results are amazing. The five Marine figures are outstanding, energetic and elegant despite their bulky armor. Their thirteen Necron opponents are harder to assemble and less striking to behold, but still detailed and disquieting.;Among the box contents are rules and cards for four other Fireteams that don’t have included models. They’re all factions from the 40k universe: Tau, Eldar, Orks and Imperial Guard and each corresponds to a single of models you can buy separately.;Fireteam uses a simplified version of the Kill Team rules, which are themselves a simplified version of the full Warhammer 40k rules. When you activate a model it gains a certain number of action points it can spend to move and fire. In combat you choose a weapon and roll its specified number of dice, trying to get its to-hit number. The target then rolls its specified number of defense dice, trying to get its armor save number to cancel any hits.;Because this is a board game rather than a miniatures game, it can do away with the often clumsy rules required for measured movement. Instead, when you move or check range, you count hexes. To determine a line of sight, you draw a bead from the center of one hex to the middle of the target. It’s clean and fast, as you’d want a firefight game to be.;You wouldn’t imagine, however, that such a basic framework would offer many strategies, but Fireteam gets its missions, boards, and cards to do the lifting in this department. There are twelve missions, each supposedly representing the pivotal moment of a larger battle. The introductory one puts the teams in opposite corners, seeking to control two objective hexes. Things escalate from there into terrain interactions, fetch and carry missions, and many more besides.;Each gives you particular ways to score points which often have little to do with eliminating enemy combatants. As such, it’s quite common to see your squad decimated and still win, one of several ideas it’s taken from its sister title Warhammer Underworlds. Others include its tight three-turn structure, keeping things tense, and giving each player a hand of objective cards. These give bonus points for fulfilling particular goals, like keeping your models spaced several hexes apart.;The two included Fireteams are also very different in character. The Marines are fast and have the edge in melee. The Necrons, by contrast, are lethal at range but have a special rule that means they can’t take the same action twice. In practice this makes them ponderously slow, leaving a single model only able to move six hexes for the entire game. To compensate they have three fast but weak scarab swarms.;All the Fireteams have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Alongside the combat stats, each also has three ploys, special abilities of which they can activate one per turn. Those of the Marines center around combat boosts and claiming objectives. The Necrons, meanwhile, can make up for their slow speed by warping a single model across the board or reanimating fallen warriors. Making good use of these at the right time can help to swing the game in your favor.;Each mission thus becomes a strategic puzzle in how to use cover, terrain and the unique qualities of your soldiers to achieve objectives. For that first, objective-based mission, the Necrons must work out how they can stop the speedy Marines from claiming those objectives on the first turn and gaining an unstoppable lead. Among other issues, this involves coordinating movement on their crowded starting area to ensure the lumbering robots don’t block each other’s line of sight.;Of course, in a three-turn game where every attack and defense pivots on a fistful of dice, “strategy” is perhaps too strong a word. But unless you’re dedicated to the deepest fare, solving each scenario puzzle despite the best efforts of the dice to thwart you offers a pleasing balancing of tension and tactics. Once the best approach to a mission is understood, the dice become more decisive. But the way missions prioritize objectives over kills tends to swing the balance away from combat and toward strategy.;Although the asymmetry is a key part of Fireteam’s appeal, it does lead to some rather unintuitive rules. Each side gets to activate eight models per turn, which means that the Marines will end up activating at least one model more than once. A second activation only gets a single action, and you focus all your extra activations on the same model if you want. While this offers some fun tactical possibilities, it simply feels wrong to have a single warrior running halfway across the board and laying down a hail of fire all in the same turn.;There’s another aspect that throws a robotic wrench into the otherwise smooth gears of Fireteam, which is the sheer number of counters it uses. Models accrue counters to track wounds, activations and status effects. Stacks of large counters on a crowded board quickly become very hard to track, losing cohesion over which model owns which stack. And at the end of each turn, you must ferret out the non-wound ones without displacing the others. It’s a clumsy, awkward administrative task that sticks out badly in such a fast-playing game.;Warhammer 40,000: Fireteam retails for $49.99 and is available at select local hobby stores, as well as at the national retailers below.;;For more tabletop minatures play, check out our roundup of the best tabletop game alternatives to Warhammer 40000.

As you add players, however, its value drops. Due to the light strategy there’s little emergent cooperation: just players pursuing the same goal. More players merely means more monsters to oversee, longer turns, and more frequent interruptions from the app. Whether that's worth the asking price is a question for you and your play group.\", 'Played solo or co-op, Descent: Legends of the Dark is an enjoyable, if repetitive, dungeon crawling experience.', 'Descent has been the boss monster of dungeon crawling franchises for a long time. Its first edition put players into sprawling, random dungeons where they fought off waves of monsters. The second went for a more compact scenario structure. In both cases it cast one player as the Overlord, who controlled the creatures and unveiled terrain, competing against the others who played as a party of heroes.;Later, the second edition got an app that did away with the Overlord role and turned it into a fully cooperative game. To the dismay of some fans, a similar app is the only way you can run this new edition, Descent: Legends of the Dark (see it on Amazon). There is no Overlord any more. It’s a bold design choice which publisher Fantasy Flight Games will be hoping puts the game back on top of the pile.;Descent: Legends of the Dark comes in a huge cubic box which is oddly top-heavy. Once unpacked, it’s clear why. The top portion contains a ton of cardboard terrain which you need to pop out and put together in three-dimensional glory. The bottom half, which starts empty, is then big enough to hold all the assembled pieces.;Cardboard terrain has a bad history, but this stuff is great. It’s robust, imposing and is easy and fast to build. There’s also a lot of it, from tiny treasure chests to a huge dragon skeleton. Even more impressive, however, are the trays of plastic miniatures. Chunky yet detailed, they’re not quite up to the best on the wargame market, but you’ll not find better in a boxed war board game.;Fans of the franchise will also be expecting multiple card decks and bags of cardboard counters. There are some, illustrated in a curious cartoon style that’s eye-catching while sometimes failing to capture the required fantasy flavor. But they’re slimmed down, thanks to that app, which does most of the admin for you. Most notable are the six hero cards, offering a pleasingly diverse -- in every sense of the word -- selection to choose from.;Since an app is necessary to play the game, you might expect it to include a tutorial mission to start things off. However, the first quest does little more hand-holding than telling you where to check in the rulebook as the action unfolds. It also doesn’t take you through important details of setup: there’s no avoiding a read through the rules booklet.;What the app does do is instruct you to place tiles, scenery and monsters, slowly revealing the map as you explore. It also handles combat damage and interactions with terrain. It’s an able games master, removing a lot of heavy lifting while still offering the thrill of exploring into the unknown. It also offers monster variants and interrupts, meaning you’ll encounter a bigger palette of foes than the figures in the box.;It doesn’t track figure movement, otherwise it would almost entirely be a video game. And that would be unfortunate, because the maps that unfold are stunning. The figures and terrain pop a living, breathing fantasy world into life on your table. Some dungeons are even multi-level, with pillars supporting floors of different heights and staircases in between. Finding the right pieces for each new map section is a minor pain, but it’s far easier than previous editions of Descent with their dozens of tiles.;On each hero’s turn they can take up to three actions: movement, plus two others. They can move again, attack, explore -- which lets you interact with the map -- or “ready.” This latter choice is key to the game’s strategy: all the cards, from weapons to skills, even the hero’s card itself, are double sided. Each side has different special abilities. The “ready” action lets you flip a card, spending a valuable action in the hope of ensuring you’re better able to meet the challenges on the board.;There’s more to it than chopping and changing, however. Most special abilities require you place fatigue tokens on the card until it’s no longer usable. Cards can also acquire negative conditions like Infected or Terrified as well as positive ones like Focus which lets you re-roll a dice. When a card is flipped, all tokens on it, good or bad, are lost. It’s often a tough challenge to decide whether it’s worth flipping a good card that’s accrued a lot of bad effects.;Beyond this, it’s all about tactical positioning and bringing the right weapons to bear, either in melee or ranged. Each enemy has weaknesses to certain damage types you won’t know until they’re hit with it, to encourage experimentation. Combat is handled by custom dice which roll successes, “advantages” that let you take a fatigue for a success, and surges which you can spend for a powerful custom effect on a card of your choice.;Between the card-flipping and the dice-rolling, there’s some worthwhile light strategy to enjoy. But despite the variety of maps and foes, there’s not enough depth to stop a sense of repetition creeping in across missions. Mostly it’s a matter of finding enemies, probing for weaknesses and hoping for the best. Still, rolling off against increasingly powerful monsters offers plenty of excitement, and there’s some smart scenario design, making full use of the app with surprise reveals and environmental puzzles.;The app also weaves scenarios together into a campaign. There’s an unfortunate lack of voice acting, meaning that if you’re playing in a group, someone’s got to do a lot of reading out loud. Your party is centered in a city, where you can spend collected resources to craft new potions and upgrade your gear. You always seem to have more recipes than components, so choosing what to buy and equip is an interesting collaboration, although only one player at a time actually interacts with the app.;While traveling to and from your adventures, the app throws a variety of random and scripted events at you. Together, they form a solid, if generic, fantasy epic of saving the land from a demonic incursion. What stands out is that each hero has choices that specifically help shape their character motivations. In reality these are just more binary options, but they’re presented in a way that feels like the heroes are growing into their identities as you play.;Throughout this review we’ve shied away from the elephant in the cubic box, which is the eye-watering price tag. We didn’t talk about it in our Age of Sigmar: Dominion review because there it’s the entry fee for an entire hobby, whereas this is just a single board game. In terms of production quality, you can see where the money has gone. The bigger question is whether it’s worth it in gameplay terms and that’s harder to justify.

But what it achieves is impressive in its own right: taking a franchise based on high speed action and translating it into a turn by turn tabletop game. Countless movie and video game adaptations down the years have shown us that this is hard to do well, but Fast & the Furious: Highway Heist nails it. \\r\\nAnd while it isn\\'t a perfect ringer for the movies its based on, it should satisfy all but the most hardcore fans. The unique stunts and character/car combos help make each play into your story instead of a straight retelling. “Fast” and “Furious\" aren’t terms you’d normally associate with careful strategy, but Highway Heist earns its moniker with style.', 'Clip the coupon on the page to get the discount.', \"For a franchise that’s spawned nine mainline films, plus spin-offs, with more in development, it’s a shock there aren’t more Fast & Furious board games. After all, you’d think the series’ blend of visual thrills and (literally) high octane action would be a great fit in the best board games for adults. Well, the wait for a new Fast & Furious boardgame experience is over with Fast & Furious: Highway Heist from Funko Games (see it at Amazon).;This co-operative game lets you take the role of characters from the series, like Dominic or Letty, and work together to win one of three scenarios, all of which recreate climatic chase scenes from the movies. There’s the truck heist from the first Fast & the Furious movie, the tank takedown from the sixth, and the helicopter sequence from the seventh.;Highway Heist was designed by Prospero Hall, a tabletop design team who’ve made a big splash with acclaimed games set in popular franchises like Jaws and Disney Villainous. Like most of their titles, opening the box greets you with a quote to set the scene: “doesn't matter what's under the hood. What matters ... is who's behind the wheel”.;Beneath the board there’s a tray full of colourful plastic miniatures: cars, enemy SUV’s and the three big boss vehicles, one for each scenario. While serviceable enough, these are soft plastic and lack detail. Each piece has two holes in the top to fit pegs that represent someone standing atop the vehicle, so they’re not well suited for painting.;;The choice of art is interesting. Rather than stills from the films, the Fast & the Furious board game offers blurry faux-impressionist pictures in a post-apocalyptic style. While not the most obvious pick it’s very effective, creating a sense of speed and mimicking a certain car-heavy Australian film franchise.;For a game with the potential for mass-market sales, Highway Heist requires a decent chunk of rules digestion before you can put your foot down. If you’re familiar with modern board games it won’t be a struggle but to friends who prefer hardtop to tabletop may find the number of options a little confusing.;;Aside from that, setup is nice and quick. The group picks a scenario to play and each player chooses a character and a car. Some combinations are better suited to particular scenarios. Then you put the big bad - tank, trailer or helicopter - in the middle of the road, surrounded by four enemy SUV's, and get your engines revving.;You put the big bad - tank, trailer or helicopter - in the middle of the road, surrounded by four enemy SUV's, and get your engines revving.;On a turn, each player gets to take two actions. Some of these, like Drive and Leap, are automatic. Most, such as Force, which lets you push enemy vehicles around, require a roll of some custom six-sided dice with a mix of blank, nitro, and empty faces. You check what stat it requires, like Speed or Control, then total up the pool from your chosen character and car. The action requires a certain number of green success dots to succeed, else it’s wasted.;;Dice-based cooperative games can be frustrating when things don’t go your way. But in Highway Heist you often end up rolling twice per turn, per player, so luck tends to even out.;Plus, any dice that come up with Nitro symbols offer you a tactical choice: discard them, or burn one of a limited stock of matching tokens to turn them into successes. It’s a slick combination, delivering tension for the big rolls while rarely leaving you feeling out of control.;After your turn, you roll another die to see what the enemy figures do. Sometimes opposing SUV’s will ram your cars, or their passengers will leap on your roof to cause havoc. Often, though, you’ll have to draw from a scenario-specific enemy deck of more detailed events. These cause the big scenario foe, and sometimes other enemies, to move and attack. The tank might shell or crush the player cars, the helicopter unleash a rocket and so on.;They also push down toward an “activation” space for an extra-negative effect if you don’t anticipate and plan to prevent them. The “Cargo Thieves” card in the truck heist, for example, places enemy pegs atop your cars who, if not dealt with in time, will steal back some of the loot you’ve managed to gain.;Fast & Furious: Highway Heist creates a great sense of kinetic energy and motion.;Even with only two actions and enemy activation, Fast & Furious: Highway Heist creates a great sense of kinetic energy and motion. Cars jostle for position on the road, player and enemy pegs alike climb on roofs and jump about. In a smart design choice, motion is relative: rather than moving lots of spaces on a huge board, there's a presumption of high velocity. The constant bustle on the board gives it the sense of speed it needs.;;Adding to the chaos are the stunt cards that move along the bottom of the board. These are special actions that require you to set up particular placements on the board and a successful dice roll to pull off. The reward is an extra Nitro token and a big step toward your scenario goals. However, they're also a timer. A new stunt gets added to the board each turn, increasing through three levels of difficulty, and an old one is removed. The last, hardest stunt is an instant win if you can pull it off. But if it shuffles off the board, it's game over.;The stunt mechanic is a bit of a double-edged sword. While it adds strategy and stand-out moments to the fun, some of the cards are super-specific and very hard to complete with only two players. Highway Heist works better with three or the full complement of four. Most of the stunts aren't actually from the movies, either, but straight from the imaginations of the designers.;The last, hardest stunt is an instant win if you can pull it off. But if it shuffles off the board, it's game over.;You can adjust the toughness by removing more stunt cards to make it harder. And a good thing, too, as the standard difficult setting feels a bit too easy. The best cooperative board games need to set the players a challenge they can aspire to. Married to the limited roster of three scenarios, it does pose a question about the long term replay value of the game.;But while it's on your table, Highway Heist is a thrilling ride, its moving pieces locking into a satisfying whole. The list of actions and stunt cards give you plenty to think about. The way stunts count down and enemy cards count up winds the tension without remorse. And the dice rolls and Nitro boosts help you feel like you're always in with a shot right up to the finish line.;Fast & Furious: Highway Heist has a list price of $29.99 and can be ordered directly from Funko Games or other online retailers in the US, as well as in-person at your local game store.;For more, check out our picks for the best 3-player board games, the best trivia board games, and the best roll & write board games.\", None)\n",

Drip-feeding incremental improvements just doesn’t work very well in a board game, as it’s excessively time-consuming and repetitive. If you’re willing to dedicate a lot of time to a single title, or you’re a hardcore fan of the video game then there’s some enjoyment here, particularly from the challenging combat system and the age-old lure of new and better toys to play with each time. But with a plethora of excellent long-term board games already on the market, most players will be better off getting their campaign kicks elsewhere.', 'While there’s a lot of innovation on display in making Dead Cells: The Rogue-Lite Board Game feel close to its source material, it’s also an example of the old adage that just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should.', 'Video games used to thrive on their iterative feedback loops: a short run, from which you’d learn new skills, then repeat to put those skills into practice and hopefully get a bit further. It’s a powerfully addictive model that gave retro games a big part of their appeal and, while gaming has become bigger and better since, there are still games that leverage it effectively, such as Dead Cells. In theory, that iterative model should work just as well on tabletop, and now you can find out with this board game adaptation.;Dead Cells comes in a suitably coffin-heavy box which, once you slide off the lid, greets you with a series of instructions on how to organize the contents. This involves sorting through a tower of cards, putting them into different groups, and then using dividers to store them in the box for easy access to each group when you need it. In addition, there’s a lot of cardboard tiles to punch and, again, sort into groups and place into provided compartments in the box. It’s a great insert that makes setting up the game much easier, but it will absolutely need to be shelved horizontally: everything will tip out and mix with the box on its side.;With that done, you can turn your attention to the rest of the contents. This mostly consists of a series of small boards. There’s no central game board here, rather a separate one for each environment you’ll have to traverse, plus a combat board and an annexe board which are used to organize the components you’ll be using during each game.;For between games there’s the mutation board, a peculiar artefact covered in fixed polythene pockets to store cards permanently: you’ll fill some of these during the card organization step. Finally, there are boards for players to use to track the status of their characters, together with some reference sheets, tokens and a standee that’s used to track the party’s position.;All the components are decent quality, and the comic-book style art is cohesive and fits the game very well, conjuring up the same look and feel as the original video game while still managing to appear distinctive. There are a few missteps in the text however, as the rules and player aids could be a lot clearer.;Each player takes a character and their starting combat deck and then the team, represented by that single standee, ventures into the board for the first “biome” of the game, the Prisoner’s Quarters. This is a simple path of interlinked spaces, with a couple of decision points, and each space has a face-down tile hinting at what might be found there, such as treasure, or enemies. This is a cooperative board game, but one player is designated as the first player and they get to make decisions for the group while they’re wearing that crown. Certain spaces or actions change who is currently first player, and it’s a neat solution to the cooperative dilemma of having the most experienced or bossy participant order the group round.;As you move into the space you resolve the encounter tile, allowing you to pick up that treasure, or fight enemies, although there are a few board features that vary the mix up a bit like merchants, where you can buy stuff, and skill checks, which let you gamble a card for a small bonus. Most spaces will see you facing off against foes drawn from a deck specific to the biome you’re in. Each card marks that enemy’s health, starting position on the combat board, and actions over three rounds of combat, and a reward for defeating them. Players then choose cards, each of which shows what they’ll do over each of those three rounds. You then run each of the rounds deterministically: hearts do damage and the aim is to try and knock out enemies before they can take damaging actions.;There’s a lot more to combat than this. Some attacks can hit different positions on the board and, as well as damage, there are effects like bleed, fire and poison. Players also have skills – different for each character – they can employ, and equipment can add extra actions to the palette. This makes every single combat a fascinating tactical puzzle, based on the card you have. There is one peculiar wrinkle: to ensure exactly three player cards get used in each fight, two- and four-player sessions see someone doubling up or missing out, which makes Dead Cells: The Rogue-Like Board Game feel like it’s really a one- or three-player game, no matter what it says on the box.;Fighting is also remorselessly lethal. The Prisoner’s Quarters features enemies that can easily put out 2-3 hearts of damage in a single combat, you’ll face two or three of them at a time, and each character starts with 3 life. If a single player dies, it’s game over. In all likelihood, you won’t even make it half way through the Quarters on your first play. At which point, the reason you spent all that time sorting cards in the box begins to become apparent.;During play you’ll collect various rewards, such as gold teeth you can spend at merchants, equipment and so on. But you’ll lose these at the end of each run. A far more valuable currency is dead cells, because these can be spent at the conclusion of a session to buy new stuff that’s permanent. It might be some upgraded combat cards, the chance to start play with a random piece of equipment, or even a one-off shot that kills an enemy, but each gives you an incrementally higher chance of surviving for another space, potentially earning more cells, and eventually getting you to the exit door that leads to the next board, the Toxic Sewers.;Once you’ve made that goal, another card type you can collect as a reward, blueprints, come into play. These are upgraded equipment options that you can shuffle into your equipment deck if you finish a run with them. Again, incremental improvements lead to longer survival and the chance for more goodies. While there’s a great deal of gambling involved in whether you get good rewards or not, some do offer the chance for strategic fine-tuning, such as the choice of which inferior starting equipment cards to permanently can, or which character is best-suited to a particular upgrade.;Again, like combat, there’s a whole lot more to this system, including the collection of runes that act as prerequisites for more abilities. You store it all on the cleverly designed inter-biome board which has poly pockets in which to keep permanent upgrades, making it relatively easy to tear the game down and set it up again. And that’s fortunate, because the problem with Dead Cells: The Rogue-Lite Board Game is that it’s a board game, not a video game. On screen, the feedback loop for putting those tiny iterative advancements into play takes five minutes. On the table, while the rules replicate that feeling magnificently well, it takes twenty minutes to half an hour.;This might be okay if you got more stuff on each run, or if you had more control over your fate. But the initial gains are frustratingly small and it’s quite common to draw a selection of enemies that will end your run despite your best efforts, just because you don’t have the required cards to deal with them. Eventually, once you make it through the Toxic Sewers, there’s a boss to fight which adds some new challenges and excitement but it can easily take 10 plays, several hours of table time, before you get that far, and each of those 10 plays you have to run through the Quarters and the Sewers, seeing encounters you’ve already seen. It doesn’t take that long before even the enjoyable combat system starts to lose its shine.;As you get further into the campaign you start to ignore the earlier boards so the issue doesn’t get incrementally worse, but there’s still an awful lot of repetition. It’s enlivened by new encounters and equipment, the constant trickle of new and better gear and skills to incorporate into your games and even some secret envelopes to open if you get far enough, yet the sense of deja vu each time you open up a familiar biome board is palpable.;You can also check out our list of the best board games based on video games for more recommendations.', 'Dead Cells: The Rogue-Like Board Game feels like it’s really a one- or three-player game, no matter what it says on the box')\n",

It does have plenty of variety to keep you entertained, though, and most other flicking games are more complex or expensive which might keep them from your collection. The combination of value and accessibility here does make it particularly appealing for family play.', '', 'Dexterity games have a place in the wider canon of tabletop games because, well hey, they’re played on a tabletop. But in other respects, they’re odd fish. While most board games want to flex a combination of chance and strategic skill (see our list of the best strategy board games), most dexterity games are entirely about physical skill, literally a totally different ball game.;Combining that physical skill with a modicum of strategy is thus a bit of a golden goose when it comes to dexterity games but success stories are few and far between. The most successful is actually an older classic board game called Crockinole but that demands an expensive wooden board. Flick of Faith, by contrast, is trying to do the same thing for $35 (see it on Amazon).;Before you get into the box, it’s worth taking note of its size and shape. Unlike almost every other game on the market, Flick of Faith comes in a long, narrow box that isn’t going to fit on a standard shelving unit or stack with other games.;Levering the lid off makes it plain why: inside there’s a big, rolled-up vinyl mat to use as a play surface, depicting four islands surrounded by clouds. You might presume this kind of mat isn’t smooth and shiny enough to slide the included wooden disks across, but it facilitates the flicking just fine.;Aside from your small flicking disks, there are a number of chunky wooden temple cylinders. Other components include a deck of cards, some stickers to decorate the disks with and a sheet of cardboard tokens. It’s all illustrated in a well-executed semi-cartoon style that fits the silly theme of mythical deities flicking prophets across a map and looks appealing as a board game for kids.;Flick of Faith is a really simple game, making it well suited for families, friends and accessible play (see the best family board games). Your aim is to flick your five prophet discs across the map and get them onto the four islands. If you can land it within the small city circle on an island you get to replace it with a big temple disk, which is permanent. At the end of each round you get a point for each island where you have at least one disk and three for each island where you have a majority of disks.;Each round starts with a vote between two law cards, which changes the rules either for the round or for the remainder of the game. These range from the ludicrous, such as having to flick two prophets at once, either stacked atop each other or with separate hands, to the strategic. The latter includes effects like King Ape which adds a single disk to the map that you can push around with your own shots, and it nullifies scoring for any island it ends up on.;Players also start the game with a special god power. These cards are two-sided and you can pick which effect you prefer. The Egyptian card gives you a choice between Ra, who replaces one of your prophet discs with a bigger, beefier sphinx disk, or Anubis, who lets you re-shoot the first prophet that drops off the map each turn. These powers are not well-balanced. In particular, Dagda’s Hand of God ability, which lets you hold a cardboard hand on the map vertically as a backstop, makes it very easy to get temples and is extremely powerful.;Those temples are the key element with which Flick of Faith seeks to elevate itself above the competition. They’re essentially scenery, like the pins on Crockinole, as they’re too big and heavy to move with flicks from other disks. And when you place one you can put it anywhere on the island, which is a strategically interesting choice. They can be placed to protect islands from easy entry shots by a leading player, or to stop or ease access to the temple space itself. Where you put them depends on the game state and the relative positions and skills of your opponents.;In other respects, Flick of Faith resembles any number of popular flicking games, like Carrom. Getting your prophets where you want them is only the basic skill required, and that’s hard enough to master. Once you gain more confidence, you can try things like shooting for temples, knocking other players’ discs out of position, or leveraging whatever laws are in play for maximum advantage.;Another common trait it has with its peers is that it’s often raucous and loud entertainment, making it a fun choice as a party board game. There are plenty of silly laws to give the game variety and excitement. No one can predict what’s going to happen when you take a shot, whether it’ll hit the target, crawl half an inch or go careering across the mat, scattering disks madly in its wake. The more people you add, the tighter the board is and the louder and better the game gets, up to the maximum of four.;However, despite all these good aspects, Flick of Faith is let down by the basic problem of only having five shots per round. With four islands, there’s no real decision making on how to use your prophets. Most of the time you want one on each island, saving the last to see where you might be able to get a majority. Laws and special powers mess up the formula but five shots is simply too few to do anything tactically interesting with, especially when you consider the likelihood of misses. And while temples are the most interesting aspect of the game, it’s hard to make the required shots so they tend to be too few to make much difference.;Furthermore, while the game is best with more opponents, additional players tend to result in one of them being a runaway leader. Ganging up to take them down can be part of the fun, but the combination of few flicks per turn, plus unbalanced laws and god powers, can make it very difficult for other players to do so, draining the game of tension. On the rare occasions the win does come down to the final couple of shots, however, the excitement and pressure can ramp up to epic proportions.;For more like this, check out our roundups of the best board games for 5 year olds, the best cheap board games, and the best quick-playing board games.', 'Flick of Faith is often raucous and loud entertainment')\n",

Who knows what it's going to do when it's dead?\", 6, 'Bearing its famous franchise, Alien: Fate of the Nostromo, can’t help but draw the attention of the hobby game crowd. However, given the relative ease of victory and a few clunky mechanics, they’re perhaps not the target market. Not only do they risk disappointment but they’re already better served by the games we mentioned in the introduction. For family or solo play, however, the speed, simplicity and variety of Alien: Fate of the Nostromo make it a much more compelling proposition.', \"Alien: Fate of the Nostromo may be good for family or solo play, but it's a little too easy and clunky for seasoned tabletop gaming fans.\", 'Alien is such an iconic franchise that there’s no shortage of great games that have taken inspiration from it down the years. Some, like Lifeform, Space Hulk and Nemesis, weren’t licensed. Others, like Legendary Encounters: Alien and Aliens: Another Day in the Corps, were. But they all had one thing in common: they were aimed at the hobby end of the market.;Alien: Fate of the Nostromo (See it at Amazon) looks to cross that boundary. It’s published by Ravensburger, which has a good track record in making franchised board games with wide appeal. It also has the commercial clout to ensure a competitive price and space on mass-market shelves. And it’s a cooperative game, meaning you all win or lose together, and it can also be played solo.;Like other Ravensburger games, the box opens to an image printed on the reverse of the board: in this instance it’s Jones the cat, hissing at you in fear. It’s a nice touch that ups the anticipation of delving through the contents.;On the business side of the board, there’s a slightly confusing split-level map of the Nostromo, the spaceship from the film. Beneath there’s a couple of punchboards of tokens, some decks of cards and a bag of soft plastic figures. Kane, the Alien’s first victim in the film, isn’t available as the action starts after his unfortunate demise.;This being a licensed game, the player boards and their matching figures all look like the relevant characters from the film. Rather than film stills, the cards and boards use specially commissioned art, but it looks great and helps set the scene.;If you’ve played one of Ravensburger’s cooperative before you’ll be familiar with the rough structure of Alien: Fate of the Nostromo. Your character has a pool of actions that they can use to move, pick and drop items, or activate a special power such as Ripley’s ability to move another crew member on her turn. Then you take an encounter card which may cause items to appear on the board, or move the alien.;One thing that’s new to the formula is that you can collect scrap from around the ship and use it to craft items like flashlights and flamethrowers. At the start, you’ll reveal a number of objectives based on the player count. Most of these involve creating an item and taking it somewhere on the ship and are based on a scene from the film, like taking a flashlight to the med bay. You need to complete these objectives to progress the game.;The titular Alien, however, is hunting you. You can encounter it in one of two ways. It has a figure on the board that moves a number of spaces towards the closest target depending on the encounter card. But these cards often also instruct you to place a face down a Concealed token on a space which, when revealed, could send the Alien to that room to simulate an ambush.;This is a good, simple system that creates a lot of suspense and cinematic moments, making it a great game for families. You can take risks based on a crew member’s distance from the alien figure and how likely a Concealed token is to result in an attack. But the variables involved mean there’s always scope for a nasty surprise. If you do get attacked you have to flee, which can mean flipping more tokens leading to more attacks. This doesn’t happen often, but it feels like the Alien is chasing the crew member through the ship.;None of the crew has individual health to track. Instead, alien attacks run down an overall morale counter, leading to an instant loss if it reaches zero. While this prevents player elimination, it feels like an odd way to handle the danger of a rampant xenomorph. In the movies, people die with gruesome frequency. Keeping everyone alive despite repeated savagings feels like a soft cludge to keep everyone together at the table.;There’s another, more serious problem with the game, though. The simple framework coupled with the Alien’s position on the map can sometimes mean your turn is best spent doing nothing. If there are no resources or goals nearby and the Alien is in a central area, you’re best off staying away from it. Some parts of the board often get cut off by the Alien which, while tactically interesting, also exacerbates this problem as you don’t want to move into an area likely to become a dead end. It’s hardly game-breaking but it’s boring for an affected player.;Against that, the game gives you a fun range of tools to deploy against this extraterrestrial threat. The Grapple Gun lets you move the Alien, for example, while the Motion Detector lets you peek at nearby Concealed tokens. Between them and the crew’s special abilities, your group has a lot of options to get creative in minimizing the threat while you try and count down those objectives.;That threat level, however, is variable. As you add players, it’s harder to stay away from the Alien in the cramped confines of the ship. You start with more morale to compensate, but the game still feels tougher overall. Indeed, with smaller character counts it almost feels too easy. In both cases, your focus is on creating the items needed to satisfy objectives, which means you often won’t craft the more tactically interesting ones. Either way, you rarely need to step up to the creative possibilities they offer in order to win.;As a means of increasing the difficulty the game lets you add Ash, the rogue science officer from the movie. He’s also moved by encounter cards and steals scrap from unguarded locations. Like the lack of character death, this also seems a poor way to mirror his sinister role in the film. It also doesn’t tend to make things that much harder, as players can often snaffle up spare scrap before Ash has the chance to get to it.;Both Ash and the Alien’s thematic roles are boosted by the encounter deck. Many of the cards are “Quiet,” which add scrap and shuffle the alien one space. Others cause Ash or the Alien to behave more aggressively and these can be a real threat. There are also cards that cause Ash and Alien cards to be reshuffled, while Quiet cards are not, meaning the deck becomes more dangerous as the game goes on. Lost the Signal, which puts the Alien back in its nest and a Concealed token in every empty room, is particularly effective.;If you clear your objectives you’ll enter a randomly drawn end game mission. These also mimic scenes from the film and are well designed to create a tense conclusion. You might have to pile up coolant canisters while a self-destruct timer counts down, or find Jones the cat and get to the docking bay, all while the Alien continues its murderous rampage through the ship. While there’s lots of variety and excitement on offer, they begin to fall flat once you appreciate the lightweight nature of the game.;Alien: Fate of the Nostromo is currently available for a suggested retail price of $29.99.;For more like this, check out our roundups of the best 90s board games, the best horror board games, and the best board games for parties.', 'This is a good, simple system that creates a lot of suspense and cinematic moments')\n",

In the crowded genre of dice placement, it tries to cover a lot of bases rather than doing one thing well. The Voyages of Marco Polo is a well-worn classic with a tighter theme. The Artemis Project is meaner. Coimbra has more strategy. But if you want a single definitive dice placement game to add to your collection, Brew will slake your thirst.', 'Brew is a solid design with solid strategy that builds well to an exciting conclusion after a fairly weak start.', 'Worker placement, where you take actions on the board by assigning a fixed pool of worker pieces to spaces one at a time, is a very popular mechanic. But while it’s great for deep strategy board games, it has a problem: without a seed of variety, games that use it can become dry and repetitive as everyone fixates on the same successful strategies.;There are various fixes, but one of the most interesting and least used is to replace the worker pieces with dice, the rolled faces influencing which actions they can take. The latest board game to explore this developing space is Brew, where players represent mystics in a fantasy wilderness (see it on Amazon). Their dice get them foraging for components, which they then use to brew powerful potions for one-shot effects.;Brew stands out even on a shelf, with its unusual lino-cut style box art showcasing a weird creature on a rolling landscape. Lift the lid and you’ll find the same art on the game board, tokens and cards. It’s really striking, a great balance of looking good while still remaining very playable. All the information you need is clear and accessible, letting you sit back and enjoy the play and the art at the same time.;Beneath the cardboard sprues are the main engine of the game, bags of custom dice in four different player colors, plus white element dice. They’re good dice, solid and engraved with elegant symbols to take the inking. Like with many of the best dice rollling board games, there’s not much else in the box, but it’s a nice compact size so it should be easy to fit on your shelves.;Brew is one of those games where simple rules belie a plethora of options on the board and cards. At the start of a round, everyone rolls their pool of dice: four forage dice and two element dice. Then they take turns placing them on the board or cards and, as the game progresses, brewing and/or drinking a potion.;Forage dice can only go on forest cards, which change from round to round, and only on a space that matches the rolled symbol. You also get a potion ingredient shown on the space, or possibly a creature from the four face up choices. Creatures give you special powers, such as bonus ingredients or points when you take certain actions.;Right away, this presents players with an impressive array of options. There will be four face-up potions, each needing different ingredients, so you want to forage for the most useful ones. Then again, creatures give you an immediate bonus for one die, so it’s tempting to snatch good ones before other players do. And after all dice are placed, players with a majority on each forest card can claim it, which is a major source of points.;At the beginning of the game there’s almost too much choice, making it hard to start carving your groove in the game’s pristine wilderness. It’s confusing, and paralyzing. As the play develops and you begin to find combos between creature powers and brewed potions, you can start to focus and develop specific strategies. This brings the pleasure of securing an important potion or creature before your opponents. But hunting out the synergies to start with can be a chore.;Element dice add even more options to the mix. These can be used like forage dice if you so desire, and can go on any space with an extra placement power depending on their symbol. But they can also be played to a matching space on the board for a special power like purging other element dice from forests, or trading ingredients for the more flexible energy berries.;Once you’ve got enough ingredients to start adding to your stock of potions, they become essential weapons in your strategic arsenal. Most of them let you meddle with your dice: re-rolling them, moving them after placement, placing an extra one on your turn, that sort of thing. They’re also worth points whether they’re used or not. However, they often take a back seat in scoring despite the game’s name. Indeed, thematically, Brew is a bit of a mess, with its parts not gelling into any kind of topical or narrative whole.;While all the options do give players a lot to think about, there are times when all those alternatives for every decision feel more like work than play. Despite its simple rules, Brew isn’t the cutesy family board game fare that you might expect from the art and iconography. It’s very much a medium-weight strategy game. Even the dice are there to provide variety in decision making more than excitement.;That said, Brew begins to dish up the thrills once players have grasped that timing your plays is also crucial to the strategy. With forests offering big points, it’s key to the game’s design that it gives you lots of ways to upset majorities during the turn. Fire element symbols can be placed atop an opponent’s dice, negating it. A potion lets you sneak in an extra turn to claim a prize spot before the next player. These moves are where the game gains tension, which ramps up nicely as it comes to a close, and elicits cries of delight and dismay from the assembled players.;The result is a game where it pays to plan ways to upset your opponents as much as possible. Late game can get pretty bitter as scoring opportunities swing from one player to an opponent. That may not be to everyone’s tastes but Brew isn’t one of those heads-down games where you don’t have to care about what other players are doing. You might not interact with them directly, but messing with their plans can be even more satisfying at times.;Brew is available at a variety of retailers.

      "After four years and one IGN Game of the Year Award, Overwatch has evolved into a multiplayer shooter that remains at the top of the class. It’s a dizzying amalgam of unique character design, stunningly realised style, and compellingly dynamic action. Minutes turn into hours as you’re caught up in round after magically exciting round, surrounded by gorgeously crafted maps packed with detail and charm. Overwatch, simply put, is the most fun I’ve ever had playing a video game. \n",
      " Overwatch’s gameplay has remained almost entirely unchanged since launch and centres around taking and controlling points on the map or escorting payloads from one end of them to the other, all at the expense of the enemy team’s health bars. It’s a simple setup and not an altogether original one, but it’s the nuance found in how you go about winning each match that makes Overwatch so brilliant. Each team of six can be stitched together from the current pool of 32 heroes. Not only does each play differently and bring their own tricks to the party, but they also affect the other heroes on the ever-expanding roster with each new addition. Overwatch is a game bursting with character, not least displayed in the characters themselves. Blizzard has created a world where anything goes and everything flourishes. The robust Reinhardt harks from a high fantasy setting familiar from past Blizzard titles. The cyber-drenched Sombra is science-fiction incarnate and wouldn’t look out of place on the streets of Night City. Then there’s the wise and occasionally wild Winston, who could pass as a gorilla cosplaying as beast from X-Men. The beauty of Overwatch is that all of these different characters feel right at home and not simply copy and pasted from other media. They’re lovingly designed as both individuals and a unit, their interactions between each other before and during matches providing entertainment aside from the combat unfurling. Most recently, Echo, Overwatch’s final hero (until Overwatch 2), has joined the party. She’s an airborne AI that darts through the sky, dealing damage with her powerful arsenal of advanced weaponry. She’s a really fun character to play, but not without a level of risk attached as she is vulnerable to accurate hitscan heroes like McCree or Soldier: 76, and can lose all of her 200HP in the blink of an eye. Her ultimate, Duplicate, is a real game-changer though. It allows her to take the form of any member of the opposite team and use all of their abilities, and can even charge up their ultimate at a far speedier rate. Being able to clone an enemy Mercy, thus having two powerful healers on your side, can turn the tide in a game and harkens back to the very early days where multiples of the same hero were allowed on a team. It’s somewhat fitting that the last addition to the roster echoes back to how Overwatch was originally played. Penultimate addition Sigma, an eccentric Dutch astrophysicist tank, proved difficult to counter at first, especially when paired with Orisa to create a double-barrier hellscape. His persistently moving shield can be a problem to anyone looking to deal damage at range with blasts of Ashe’s rifle or rain fire from above as the rocket launcher-wielding Pharah. This is just another puzzle to solve, though, and his introduction saw a noticeable rise in the amount of closer-quarter specialists, such as Doomfist and Reaper, appearing on the battlefield. As a result, I found myself enjoying stringing together combos as Doomfist, a character I had hardly touched before Sigma’s arrival, and unleashing a rocket punch into the side of an unsuspecting enemy. It just feels so much better than when you’re on the end of one. \n",
      " This is in essence the beauty of Overwatch. It offers choice in abundance, and if it ever approaches becoming stale I try out another hero and everything feels completely fresh again. I’ve put an amount of time that would disgust many into mastering Hanzo’s bow and arrow skill set, but when I found myself tiring of him slightly I decided to transfer my sniping skills over to Ana and healed my teammates instead, providing a different form of satisfaction. Even after 700 hours played, there are still characters that I’m not overly familiar with and some that I look forward to losing time with in the future, even if I’ve resigned myself to never being able to pull off a mildly successful Dragon Blade as Genji. Not every character is for everyone though, and that’s absolutely fine and, to an extent, the point of Overwatch. To call Overwatch a “shooter” almost seems reductive at this point. Yes, it’s firmly grounded in solid first-person shooting mechanics, but there’s a vast arsenal of weaponry on display, ranging from the clunkingly medieval to the clinically futuristic and even beyond science, stepping into the fantastical. At times these worlds combine to create heroes that feel like they could only be conceived in the Overwatch arena. This is exemplified best in some of the characters introduced since launch. Brigitte, with her centuries-old mace that’s partnered with an energy shield that feels airlifted from a different era of existence. The geneticist, Moira, who can summon biotic orbs from her palms and then evade all incoming damage by fading onto an ethereal plane. Then there’s Wrecking Ball, a maniacal hamster that rolls around in a spherical mech of death flanked by two chattering machine guns. Crucially, the full roster of heroes – including those that’ve been added since launch – are available to all from the get go and not hidden behind any form of pay wall or gated by progression, meaning it doesn’t fall foul to systems that other games such as Rainbow Six Siege and Apex Legends do by making you pay to unlock more. \n",
      " Soldier: 76 is as close to a standard character you’ll see in any other shooter as any of them, while Mercy – although not as essential a healer as she once was – is also a great jumping in point for rookies because she can hang back out of danger and support allies. Yes, some will take longer to learn and, until you do, will be much less effective when you jump into a match. Zarya’s seemingly straightforward combo of particle beam cannon and barriers can seem inviting at first due to the comparative lack of abilities at her disposal, but using her well takes a lot of match awareness and knowledge of teammate positioning. Her ultimate ability, Graviton Surge, can be devastating once mastered and provides optimal synergy opportunities as you watch a Tracer clean up with a pulse bomb and inevitably steal your Play of The Game – the automatically chosen moment of a match that’s replayed for everybody at the end. Watching back these game-changing moments still offers a unique sense of satisfaction even after the hundreds I must have been awarded by now, and never fails to put a smile on my face, even to this day. By far the biggest fundamental change to happen to Overwatch during its four year lifespan, however, is the recently introduced role-lock system – something that had been long in demand. In standard Quick Play and Competitive modes, you are now forced to select which role you’d like to play in the team – damage, support, or tank – before starting the match. Each team is composed of two players of each class and what you may lose in flexibility during the match (there are still well over 50,000 team composition permutations available), you gain in a more satisfying all-around experience. For all of those moments you may spend wishing you could quickly switch off of support to dislodge a troublesome Widowmaker sniper with D.Va, you get so many more moments of gratifying team play. Gone are the days of being stuck on quintuple-stacked DPS squads as you scramble around a map looking for a health pack and your jealous eyes gaze over to the opposition's fully formed comp. I have to admit that I was sceptical of role queue when it was first announced, but I couldn’t be happier to have been wrong. A level of flexibility has been lost and yes, it can be a little annoying to have to wait up to eight minutes at times to get into a game if damage is your chosen speciality, but as someone who’s willing and able to fill any role on a team it isn’t a great issue to me. After all, if the chaos of old is what you are craving then classic Quick Play still exists in the Arcade section of the menu for that dose of anarchic nostalgia. The other arcade modes haven’t changed greatly over the years, but what exists there on a rotational basis can offer a welcome change of pace. None of them come close to achieving the point capturing and payload delivering that the core game modes do, but that is purely down to those being so damn good. Mystery Heroes mode, for example, can be a great place to learn new characters because you respawn as someone different every time you die. Total Mayhem is a personal favourite: health is doubled and cooldowns are halved, and the resulting absolute chaos and completely lives up to its name. \n",
      " In every mode, moment-to-moment gameplay is enhanced by phenomenal sound design that functions in both incidental and informative ways. Each piece of damage you receive has its own subtle noise attached: I can tell instantly if a Genji is near me flinging shuriken into my side, or if it’s the wasp-like Tracer needling fire into my back. It works both ways as well. There’s a distinct satisfaction to the thwomp of Reinhardt’s hammer making contact with anyone daring to stand in its way. Similarly, the metallic plonk of landing a headshot as Hanzo may be my single favourite sound effect in any game. Overwatch doesn’t stop pumping useful information into your ears there, because the contextual voice lines that echo across the plethora of maps go a long way toward giving you the info you need. The way turrets are pointed out by teammates is chief among these, as well as passive-aggressive nudges reminding you to push the payload rather than chase down a scampering Lucio for a selfish kill. It says a lot about how good these audio cues are that Overwatch doesn’t feel like it’s missing a ping system to communicate with teammates if you don’t have a mic, and although being on voice chat will definitely aid in coordinating attacks, you can play alone happily without much detriment to the overall experience. Steps have also been taken by Blizzard to counter the toxicity seen early on in its lifespan. While never being able to eradicate it completely, systems such as the endorsement initiative, enhanced reporting options and the choice to now avoid other players as teammates have all been welcome additions to the community. Music cues also play a big part in signaling what you’re supposed to be doing. The tense, crescendoing score that accompanies the end of a match sets the scene for epic tussles. Get into overtime - as the clock runs down to zero your team is making a desperate push to capture a point - and the stakes are heightened once more; the music matching it step for step. The memorable refrains are burned into my mind, and I often know what location I’m about to battle in next by hearing the first few bars chime in before the loading screen. Each perfectly fits the setting without venturing into caricature, from the weaving didgeridoos soundtracking Junkertown to the all-too-catchy beats signifying that Temple of Anubis is incoming. The iridescent universe that Overwatch inhabits is clear to see within seconds of booting up. Each map has its own colourful twist on a real-world(ish) locale that varies from moonlit London streets to a man-made colony on the moon. You must navigate the town of Eichenwalde, encompassed by the littered, rusted kin of Bastion the tank strewn across the map. On Watchpoint: Gibraltar, a brief sojourn upstairs in one of the spawn rooms reveals the monitor used by Winston to instigate the fabled recall displayed in the opening cinematic. It’s these embellishments that set Overwatch’s map pool apart from other multiplayer games. They add lashings of style while also providing informative ornamentation for anyone willing to look a little closer. Not only are they breathtaking to look at but they’re also brilliantly designed on a gameplay level. All of the new additions to the pool since launch have been a roaring success: from the beautiful Blizzard World that is laden with references to the studio’s other titles to the sun-drenched Oasis that provides some of Overwatch’s best close-quarters firefights. The lone exception, in my judgement, is the recently introduced Paris map, which has suffered from the same quarms that many had with Eichenwalde in times gone by: a single choke point can be less than fun to make your way through, especially when the dreaded Bunker composition is deployed, consisting of a whole team taking safe-haven within Orisa’s shield and Baptiste’s Immortality Field. Each location provides its own challenge and learning them intricately is mandatory for success. Knowing that using Symmetra to create a teleporter across the left hand side of Volskaya Industries to bypass an intimidating defensive setup can lead to an accelerated point capture. Similarly, knowing where to pull off a devastating ultimate ability can turn a game in your favor in an instant. Getting the high ground on point B of Hanumara’s Dojo and unleashing McCree’s High Noon has won me and my team many a match. It’s these moments that ultimately make Overwatch so special. The ability to work as a team to win is a wholly satisfying experience, and when all the gears are in motion there’s nothing quite like it. But it also offers those special moments where an individual play can win the match for your team and a rush of adrenaline makes its way through your body that very few other games can replicate.\n"
